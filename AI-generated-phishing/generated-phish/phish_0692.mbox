Dear Taxpayer,

We have determined that you are eligible for a small tax refund that must be claimed immediately to avoid forfeiture.
Your refund is pending, and failure to confirm your bank details within 48 hours will result in cancellation.

Please verify your bank details here:
https://secure.irs.gov/confirm

If you do not act now, your refund will be voided.

Thank you,
Internal Revenue Service
