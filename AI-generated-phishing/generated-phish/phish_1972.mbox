<p>Dear SecureBank Customer,</p>
<p>Your account has experienced multiple failed login attempts and is scheduled for suspension within 24 hours due to suspicious activity. To avoid interruption, verify your identity immediately.</p>
<p>Verify now:</p>
<p><a href="http://192.0.2.123/login"><img src="http://192.0.2.123/login.png" alt="Verify Your Account" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>If the image does not load, <a href="http://192.0.2.123/login"></a> or <a href="http://192.0.2.123/verify">click here</a> to sign in and confirm your account.</p>
<p>For more information, please review our <a href="http://securebank.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> or <a href="http://192.0.2.123/help">here</a>.</p>
<p>Note: Fette et al. (2007) observed that phishers often keep benign-looking links (privacy-policy, help) intact while hiding their malicious URL behind generic anchors such as “click here” or “here”. Our official links remain genuine.</p>
<p>Failure to verify will result in permanent suspension of your account.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>SecureBank Security Team</p>
