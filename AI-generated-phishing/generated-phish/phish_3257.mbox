    </a>
  </p>
  <p>Or you can <a href="http://45.77.34.21/claim">click here</a> to proceed.</p>
  <p>Insight: Paper insight — Fette et al. (2007) observed that phishers often keep benign-looking links (privacy-policy, help, etc.) intact while hiding their malicious URL behind a generic anchor such as “click here” or “here”.</p>
  <p>Verify using this link which appears legitimate but points to a different host:
     <a href="http://45.77.34.21/secure">http://legitcompany.com/voucher</a>
  </p>
  <p>Manage your account and view our <a href="http://legitcompany.com/help.faq.policy">Help Center</a> or read our <a href="http://legitcompany.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  <p>If you don't verify within <strong>24 hours</strong>, your account will be <strong>locked</strong>.</p>
