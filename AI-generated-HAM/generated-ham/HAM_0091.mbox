Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! As we discussed in this week’s meeting, the team is planning to go out for lunch next Friday, April 22nd, at 12:30 PM. We’re thinking of trying the new Italian place downtown, Bella Cucina. They have a great selection of pastas and salads, and they accommodate dietary restrictions.

Please let me know by Wednesday, April 20th if you can make it and if you have any special dietary needs. If Italian isn’t your preference, we can consider other nearby options.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
