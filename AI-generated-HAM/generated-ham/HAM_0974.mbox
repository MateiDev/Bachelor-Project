Hi Bob,

Thanks for suggesting the weekend hiking trip! I'm excited about the idea. I did a bit of research on nearby trails and found the Pine Ridge loop. It's about 7 miles
and has beautiful lake views. The forecast looks clear on Saturday morning, which is perfect.

I could pick you up around 7 AM on Saturday if that works for you. We should bring plenty of water, some snacks, and maybe a small first-aid kit, just in case.
I can handle the sandwiches and fresh fruit. Do you want to bring anything else? Also, let me know if you prefer to start the hike earlier or later.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
