Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to follow up on our plans for the summer picnic next Saturday. Here are a few things we need to finalize:

1. Location: Central Park, near the Great Lawn entrance.
2. Time: Let’s meet around 11:00 AM so we have plenty of time to set up.
3. Food contributions:
   - I will bring sandwiches and bottled water.
   - Carmen is handling the fruit platter.
   - Would you mind bringing chips and snacks?
4. Games and activities: I’ll bring frisbees and a deck of cards. If you have anything else fun, feel free to add it.

Please let me know if this works for you or if you’d like to suggest any changes. Also, if you need a ride or want to carpool, I’m happy to coordinate.

Looking forward to a great day outdoors!

Cheers,
Alice Johnson
