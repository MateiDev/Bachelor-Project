Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Just wanted to follow up on our plan for the weekend hike at Pine Ridge Trail. The forecast looks great—sunny in the morning with a slight breeze in the afternoon. I’ve packed extra snacks and trail mix; feel free to bring any favorites you have.

Let’s meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:30 AM on Saturday. That should give us plenty of time to complete the 10-mile loop before the sun gets too high. I also downloaded the latest map and trail conditions, and everything looks clear.

If you need a ride, I can pick you up at your place around 7:45 AM. Otherwise, I'll see you at the parking area. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some fresh air!

Best regards,
Alice
