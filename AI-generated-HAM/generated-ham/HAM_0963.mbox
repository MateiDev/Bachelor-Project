Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! We're organizing a summer picnic for the team next Friday
at the Riverside Park, and I'd love for you to join us. We'll start around 11:00 AM
and plan to wrap up by 3:00 PM.

Feel free to bring your favorite snacks or games. Let me know if you have any dietary
restrictions, and I'll make sure we have something for everyone.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon outdoors! Let me know if you can make it.

Best,
Alice
