Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our planned hiking trip this Saturday. The weather forecast looks promising: sunny with highs around 65°F (18°C). I’ve mapped out a trail at Bear Creek Park that’s about 8 miles round-trip, with a scenic overlook at the halfway point.

Here’s the tentative schedule:
- 8:00 AM: Meet at the parking lot off Pine Ridge Road
- 8:15 AM: Begin the hike
- 10:30 AM: Reach the overlook for a short break and photos
- 11:00 AM: Continue along the creek loop
- 1:00 PM: Return to the trailhead

Feel free to bring a small backpack with water, snacks, and maybe a light jacket—it can get breezy near the overlook. I’ll pack some granola bars and trail mix to share. If you’d like, we can stop by that café in town afterward for coffee or lunch.

Let me know if the timing works for you or if you’d prefer to adjust. Looking forward to catching up and getting some fresh air!

Best,
Alice
