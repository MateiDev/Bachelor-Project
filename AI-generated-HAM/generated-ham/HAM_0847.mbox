Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our plan for the hiking trip this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great for the West Ridge Trail, with clear skies and a high around 68Â°F.

Here's a rough itinerary:
- 8:00 AM: Meet at my place and carpool to the trailhead
- 9:00 AM: Start the hike
- 12:30 PM: Reach the summit; break for lunch
- 3:00 PM: Head back down
- 5:30 PM: Arrive back at the cars

Let me know if this schedule works for you or if you'd like to adjust the timing. Also, don't forget to pack:
- Plenty of water (at least 2 liters)
- Snacks or a packed lunch
- A light jacket (it can get windy at the top)
- Sunscreen and sunglasses
- Your camera if you want to capture the views

I'll bring a first-aid kit and extra trail mix. If you have any other items to add, just let me know.

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
