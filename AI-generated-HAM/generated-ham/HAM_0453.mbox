Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I was thinking about our upcoming weekend plans and wanted to see if you'd like to join me for a hiking trip this Saturday. Here are the details:

- Meeting point: Pine Ridge Trailhead parking lot
- Time: 8:00 AM
- What to bring:
  * Plenty of water
  * Snacks or a packed lunch
  * Comfortable hiking shoes
  * A light jacket in case it gets chilly

The weather forecast looks great, and it should be a fun day out in nature. Let me know if you can make it, and I'll send you the exact coordinates and any additional info.

Looking forward to your reply!

Cheers,
Alice
