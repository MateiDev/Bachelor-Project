Hey Bob,

I'm writing to see if you're still up for our hiking trip this Saturday. The forecast looks great: sunny skies with a high of around 55Â°F. I was thinking we could start around 9 AM at Green Valley Trailhead. It's a moderate 6-mile loop, and there are some nice viewpoints along the way.

Let me know if that works for you. Also, if you have any other trails in mind, feel free to suggest them. I'll bring snacks and water; if you could pack some sandwiches, that would be awesome.

Looking forward to it!

Cheers,
Alice
