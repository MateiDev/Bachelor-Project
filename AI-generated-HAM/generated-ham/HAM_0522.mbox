Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this coming weekend. The weather forecast looks clear, with temperatures in the mid-60s, so it should be perfect for the trail.

Here's what I have in mind:
- Saturday morning departure around 8:00 AM.
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 9:00 AM.
- Hike the Riverbend Loop (approximately 7 miles, moderate difficulty).
- Pack a lunch to enjoy at the scenic overlook.
- Return to the cars by late afternoon.

Please bring:
1. Sturdy hiking shoes
2. Layers (it might be cooler in the morning)
3. Water (at least 2 liters)
4. Snacks and lunch
5. A small first-aid kit
6. Sunscreen and sunglasses

Let me know if that schedule works for you or if youâ€™d like to adjust anything. Also, if you have any dietary preferences or special gear needs, just give me a heads-up.

Looking forward to spending the day outdoors!

Best,
John
