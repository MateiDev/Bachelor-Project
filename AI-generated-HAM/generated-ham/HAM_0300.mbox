Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder about our upcoming weekend hiking trip to Bear Mountain this Saturday. Here's the plan:

- Departure: 7:30 AM from my place (123 Oak Street).
- Estimated return: around 6:00 PM.
- What to bring:
  * Comfortable hiking shoes
  * Water bottle (at least 1 liter)
  * Snacks/lunch
  * Light rain jacket
  * Sunscreen and sunglasses

Let me know if you need a ride or have any questions. Looking forward to spending the day outdoors with you!

Cheers,
Alice Johnson
