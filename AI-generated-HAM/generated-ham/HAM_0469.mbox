Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to check in about our hiking plans for this coming weekend. I was thinking we could head up to Pine Ridge Trail on Saturday morning. The forecast looks clear, with temperatures in the mid-70s – perfect for a day hike.

Here’s a rough itinerary:
1) Meet at my place by 7:30 AM on Saturday.
2) Drive together to the trailhead (about a 90-minute drive).
3) Start hiking around 9:30 AM.
4) Stop for lunch near the ridge viewpoint (pack sandwiches and plenty of water).
5) Wrap up the hike by late afternoon and grab coffee in town on the way back.

Gear checklist:
- Comfortable hiking boots
- Rain jacket (just in case)
- Daypack with water, snacks, and first-aid kit
- Sunglasses and sunscreen

Let me know if you’d like to adjust any times or if you have other trail suggestions. If Pine Ridge is too crowded, we could try the Oak Creek Loop instead—it’s a bit shorter but still offers great scenery.

Looking forward to hitting the trail!

Best,
Alice Smith
