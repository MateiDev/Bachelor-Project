Hello Bob,

I'm excited about our upcoming weekend hiking trip! I checked the weather forecast, and it looks like we'll have clear skies and mild temperaturesâ€”perfect hiking conditions.

Here's the tentative plan:
- Saturday, 7:00 AM: Meet at the trailhead parking lot.
- Hike the Pine Ridge loop (about 8 miles).
- Bring plenty of water, snacks, a light lunch, and sunscreen.
- We should finish by early afternoon, around 2:00 PM.

Let me know if these times work for you or if you'd like to adjust anything. Also, if you have any special dietary preferences for the lunch packs, please tell me by Friday so I can prepare accordingly.

Looking forward to hitting the trail together!

Best,
Alice Smith
