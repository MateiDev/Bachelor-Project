Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our Saturday hike at Pine Creek Trail. The forecast looks great—sunny with mild temperatures—so it should be perfect for the 8-mile loop we discussed. Let’s meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM. Don’t forget to bring enough water, some snacks, and a light jacket in case it gets breezy by the creek.

Also, I’ve attached a quick packing checklist below for reference:
- Water (2 liters per person)
- Trail mix or energy bars
- Sunscreen and a hat
- First aid kit
- Camera or smartphone for photos

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors together. Let me know if you have any questions or need to adjust the timing.

Best,
Alex Smith
