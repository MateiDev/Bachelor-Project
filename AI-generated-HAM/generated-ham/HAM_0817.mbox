Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Given the sunny forecast for this weekend, I thought it would be a great idea to organize a small picnic at Green Meadows Park. Here’s a rough outline of the plan:

1. Saturday, July 27, starting at 11:00 AM.
2. We’ll meet at the north pavilion near the lake.
3. Everyone can bring a dish to share; I’ll handle sandwiches and drinks.
4. Feel free to bring any lawn games—Frisbee, badminton, or a deck of cards.

Let me know if you can make it and what you’d like to bring. Also, if the weather changes, we can reschedule for Sunday afternoon. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
