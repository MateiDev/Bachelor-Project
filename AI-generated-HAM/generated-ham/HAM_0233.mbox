Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our community garden project this Saturday. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny in the morning and mild in the afternoon. I’ve confirmed that the gardening tools and materials (soil, seeds, gloves) will be available at the storage shed by 9:00 AM.

Here’s the tentative schedule:
- 9:00 AM: Meet at the main entrance of Greenwood Park
- 9:15 AM–11:30 AM: Soil preparation and planting new heirloom tomato seedlings
- 11:30 AM–12:00 PM: Short break with refreshments (I’ll bring lemonade and granola bars)
- 12:00 PM–1:30 PM: Weed removal around the existing flower beds
- 1:30 PM: Quick wrap-up and photos for the community newsletter

Feel free to invite any neighbors who might be interested! The more hands we have, the faster we’ll finish. If anyone prefers a later start, we can adjust the timeline accordingly.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or special requests for refreshments. Also, if you have any extra garden stakes or tomato cages, bring them along. Otherwise, I’ll pick up a few from the garden center tomorrow.

Looking forward to a productive and fun morning together. Thanks again for your help!

Best,
Alice Johnson
