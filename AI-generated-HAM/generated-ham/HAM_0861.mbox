Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about our weekend plans. The weather forecast looks great for Saturday, with sunny skies and mild temperatures. I thought we could meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM. The plan is to hike the Pine Ridge Trail, which is about 7 miles round-trip.

I'll bring sandwiches, snacks, and plenty of water. Feel free to pack anything else you'd like. After the hike, we can stop by that new caf√© in town for coffee and pastries. Let me know if that works for you or if you have any other suggestions.

Looking forward to spending the day outdoors!

Best,
John
