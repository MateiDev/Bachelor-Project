Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to confirm our team lunch this Friday at
noon. We'll meet at the new caf√© on Maple Street; they have a private room
reserved for us. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions.

Also, quick project update:
- The design draft is 90% complete.
- We've scheduled the first review meeting for Wednesday at 2 PM.
- The backend team expects to finish integration tests by the end of next week.

If you need anything else before then, feel free to reach out. Otherwise,
I'll see you at lunch!

Best,
Alice Johnson
