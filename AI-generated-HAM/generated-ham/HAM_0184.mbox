Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about going on a hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks great for Saturday, with sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-70s. Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. Meet at my place around 8:00 AM.
2. Drive up to Pine Ridge Trailhead (about a 1.5-hour drive).
3. Pack a picnic lunch to enjoy at the summit – I’ll bring sandwiches and fruit.
4. Expect to be back by late afternoon.

Can you confirm if that works for you? Also, let me know if you have any dietary preferences or if there’s anything specific you’d like to bring. I’ve checked the trail conditions online and everything seems clear, but I’ll call the visitor center one more time on Friday to make sure.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some fresh air!

Best,
Alice Johnson
