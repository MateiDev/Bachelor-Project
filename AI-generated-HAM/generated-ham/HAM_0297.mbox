Hello Team,

I hope you're all doing well. As summer is settling in, I thought it would be nice for us to get together outside of the office for a casual team lunch next Friday, June 21st, at 12:30 PM.

Location: The Green Park Pavilion (123 Elm Street, Springfield)
Menu: We're planning a build-your-own sandwich bar, with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options available.

Please let me know by Monday if you can make it and any dietary restrictions you have. If the weather doesn't cooperate, we'll move indoors to the conference room on the 5th floor and order in.

Looking forward to seeing everyone and catching up over good food!

Best regards,
Alice
