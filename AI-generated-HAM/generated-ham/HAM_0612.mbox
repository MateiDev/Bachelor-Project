Hi Bob,

Thanks again for taking the time to meet this morning. Iâ€™ve attached the revised project timeline and the updated task assignments that we discussed. Please review and let me know if you have any questions or if anything needs further adjustment.

As a reminder, our next checkpoint is scheduled for Thursday at 2 PM. If you need to reschedule, just let me know and we can find a better slot.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Alice
