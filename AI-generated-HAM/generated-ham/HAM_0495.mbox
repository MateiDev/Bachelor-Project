Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I’d like to organize a team lunch next week to catch up and discuss our upcoming project milestones. Does Tuesday or Wednesday work better for you? Please let me know your availability, and I’ll coordinate with the rest of the team.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
Alice
