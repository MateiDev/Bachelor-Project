Hey Bob,

I hope you made it home safely after our hike on Saturday. The weather was perfect, and I’m still buzzing from reaching the summit of Pine Ridge Trail. Thanks for carrying most of the snacks—you really saved the day with those granola bars!

I organized all the photos we took and uploaded them to our shared folder. Feel free to pick your favorites and send them to anyone who might want copies. I’ve also started planning our next outdoor adventure; I’m thinking about kayaking at Lake Meadowbrook in early July. Let me know if you’re up for it, and we can nail down a date.

Enjoy the rest of your weekend, and give my regards to Emma.

Cheers,
Alice
