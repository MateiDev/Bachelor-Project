Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! As we discussed at last week’s town meeting, we’re organizing a community potluck next Saturday, July 24th, at Maple Park Pavilion starting at 1:00 PM. The goal is to bring neighbors together for an afternoon of fun, food, and friendly conversation.

Could you let me know what dish you’d like to bring? We’re aiming for a good mix of salads, main dishes, desserts, and beverages. So far, Claire has offered to handle the drinks, and Jamal is bringing his famous veggie lasagna. If you have any serving utensils you can lend, that would be a big help too.

Also, we’ll need a few volunteers to help with setup and cleanup. If you’re available at noon on the 24th, we’ll meet at the pavilion to arrange tables and decorations. Otherwise, feel free to swing by after your dish is dropped off.

Thanks for pitching in, and I look forward to catching up at the potluck! Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Best regards,
Alice Smith
