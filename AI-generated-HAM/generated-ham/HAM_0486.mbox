Hi Bob,

Are we still on for lunch tomorrow at the campus cafe? I was thinking around 12:30 pm should be good. Let me know if that works for you, or if youâ€™d prefer somewhere else.

Also, I wanted to discuss the project timeline and get your thoughts on the upcoming deadline.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
