Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing with the final details for our hiking trip this weekend.

Meeting Point and Time:
- Trailhead parking lot at Pine Ridge Park.
- Saturday, July 29th at 8:00 AM sharp.

Route Plan:
1. Start on the Pine Ridge loop (approx. 3 miles).
2. Break for lunch near Eagle Point Overlook.
3. Continue on the creekside trail back to the parking area.

What to Bring:
- Comfortable hiking shoes or boots.
- Layers of clothing (mornings can be cool).
- Water (at least 2 liters).
- Snacks or a packed lunch.
- Sunscreen and insect repellent.
- A small first-aid kit.

Transportation:
I'll drive my SUV and can take you and Mark. Let me know if that works for you both, or if you need a ride separately.

Weather Forecast:
The forecast looks sunny with highs around 78Â°F and a gentle breeze. Perfect hiking weather!

Looking forward to spending the day outdoors and catching up. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.

Best,
John
