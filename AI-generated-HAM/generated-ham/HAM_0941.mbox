Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Our annual summer picnic is coming up on Saturday, August 3rd, and I’d love to get your input on the plans. Here’s a rough outline:

1. Location: Riverside Park, Shelter #4
2. Time: 11:00 AM – 4:00 PM
3. Menu:
   - Main dishes: grilled chicken, veggie burgers
   - Sides: potato salad, coleslaw, fresh fruit
   - Drinks: lemonade, iced tea, water
   - Desserts: cookies, brownies
4. Activities:
   - Frisbee and volleyball
   - Nature walk along the river trail
   - Kids’ scavenger hunt

Could you let me know:
- Any dietary preferences or allergies we should accommodate?
- If you can bring one of the side dishes or a dessert?
- Whether you have any equipment we could borrow (e.g., a cooler or extra folding chairs)?

Feel free to suggest any other ideas or changes. Once we finalize the details, I’ll send out a formal invite with a sign-up sheet.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Alice
