Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our upcoming weekend hiking trip to Bear Mountain. The weather forecast is looking great—sunny skies with a gentle breeze. I'm planning to start early on Saturday to avoid the afternoon crowds.

Let me know if you need to borrow any gear. I have an extra pair of trekking poles and a lightweight tent, in case yours is still drying out from the last trip. I’ll also bring along some extra snacks—trail mix, sandwiches, and plenty of water.

If you’d like, I can pick you up around 7:00 AM. Otherwise, feel free to meet me at the trailhead by 8:00. Either way works for me. 

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the fresh air!

Best,
Alice
