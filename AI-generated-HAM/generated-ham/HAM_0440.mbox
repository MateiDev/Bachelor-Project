Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share the agenda for our project kickoff meeting scheduled next Monday:

1. Welcome and introductions
2. Project overview and objectives
3. Timeline and milestones
4. Roles and responsibilities
5. Next steps and Q&A

Please review the agenda and let me know if you’d like to add any topics. The meeting will take place on July 17th at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B. I’ll send a calendar invite shortly.

Looking forward to getting started!

Best regards,
Alice
