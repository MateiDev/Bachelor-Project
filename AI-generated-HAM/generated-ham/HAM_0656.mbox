Hello Book Club Members,

Just a friendly reminder that our next meeting will be on Thursday, June 27th at 7:00 PM in the community center lounge. We’ll be discussing “The Midnight Library” by Matt Haig, so please finish reading chapters 1–10 before then.

Agenda:
1. Welcome and introductions
2. Book discussion (Chapters 1–10)
3. Selection of next month’s book
4. Snacks and social time

Please bring your copy of the book and any notes or comments you’d like to share. If you have any dietary restrictions for the refreshments, let me know by Tuesday.

Looking forward to a great discussion!

Warm regards,
Alice
