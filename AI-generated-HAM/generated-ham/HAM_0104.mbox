Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! With the weather looking nice this weekend, I thought it would be a great time to get started on planting the new vegetable garden. I’ve already picked up tomato, pepper, and basil seedlings from the nursery.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Saturday morning: Clear out the existing beds and add fresh compost.
- Saturday afternoon: Lay out the seedling placements and start planting the tomatoes.
- Sunday morning: Plant the peppers and basil, then water everything.

Do you have any extra tools like a trowel or gardening gloves I could borrow? Also, feel free to invite Clara if she’d like to join us—she’s welcome!

Let me know if this plan works for you, or if you have any suggestions.

Thanks, and talk to you soon!

Best,
Alice
