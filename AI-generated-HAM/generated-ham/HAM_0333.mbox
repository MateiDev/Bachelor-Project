Hey Bob,

Hope you're doing well! Just a quick note to remind you about our monthly book club lunch next Thursday at 12:30 PM. We'll be meeting at The Corner Caf√© on Maple Street. They've added a few new vegetarian options to the menu that I think you'll enjoy.

Feel free to bring the latest book you've finished if you'd like to share some thoughts with the group. This month, we're focusing on short stories, so even if you only have a favorite author or two, that's perfect.

Let me know if you need a ride or if anything changes. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
