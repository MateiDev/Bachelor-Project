Hi Bob,

Are you still up for the hiking trip this weekend? I checked the trail conditions and the weather looks promising. I propose we meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM on Saturday. Don't forget to bring water, snacks, and a light jacket.

Let me know if that works for you or if you prefer another time.

Best,
Alice
