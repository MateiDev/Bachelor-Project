Hello John,

We are hosting a team lunch next Friday, September 15th, at The Green Garden cafeteria in Building A.
The lunch will start at 12:30 PM and is scheduled to end by 2:00 PM. This is a great opportunity for
everyone to catch up and discuss ongoing projects in an informal setting.

Please RSVP by replying to this email by Wednesday, September 13th, so we can finalize the headcount
with the cafeteria staff.

If you have any dietary restrictions or special requests, feel free to mention them in your response.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
HR Department
