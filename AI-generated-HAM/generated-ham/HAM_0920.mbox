Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about the weekend hiking trip. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with mild temperatures, perfect for being outdoors.

I checked our usual trail at Maple Ridge, and the parking area is expected to open by 8:00 AM. If we meet at my place at 7:00 AM, we can carpool and still grab coffee on the way. I suggest packing the usual gear—water, snacks, sturdy shoes, and a light jacket for the ridge top breeze.

Let me know if that schedule works for you. Also, if you’d like to invite Mark and Lisa along, just give me a heads-up so I can coordinate the car space.

Looking forward to a fun day on the trail! Feel free to reply with any thoughts or adjustments.

Best,
John
