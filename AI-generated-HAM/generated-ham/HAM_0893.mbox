Hello John,

I hope you’re doing well. As discussed in last week’s meeting, we'd like to organize a team lunch to celebrate our recent project milestone. How does Thursday, August 3rd at noon sound to you?

The plan is to meet at Blossom Café (downtown location) and try their seasonal menu. If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, please let me know so I can inform the restaurant.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
