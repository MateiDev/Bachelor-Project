Hello Community Garden Volunteers,

I hope this message finds you well. As summer approaches, it’s time for our annual community garden cleanup. The event will take place on Saturday, June 25th, from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM at the East End Community Garden (123 Greenway Lane).

We will be weeding, pruning, and preparing the soil for planting. Please bring gardening gloves, a hat, and plenty of water. If you have any rakes, trowels, or shovels you can lend, that would be greatly appreciated.

After the cleanup, we’ll have a small picnic with sandwiches, fruit, and cold drinks. Feel free to bring a snack or beverage to share.

To help us plan, please reply to this email by Monday, June 20th, letting me know if you can make it and what tools you can bring. If you have any questions or suggestions, don’t hesitate to ask.

Thank you for your continued support. I’m looking forward to seeing everyone and making our garden thrive this season.

Best regards,
Alice
Volunteer Coordinator
