Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Are you free this Friday afternoon? I was thinking we could try that new Mediterranean restaurant downtown around 12:30 PM. Iâ€™ve heard good things about their falafel and grilled lamb.

Let me know if that time works for you, or if you'd prefer a different spot. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
