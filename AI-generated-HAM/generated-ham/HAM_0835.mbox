Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to remind you about our annual team picnic scheduled for Thursday, August 5th, at Lakeside Park. We'll be meeting by the pavilion at 11:30 AM, and lunch will be served around noon. Feel free to bring along any games or outdoor equipment you enjoyâ€”frisbees, cornhole, and soccer balls are all welcome.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or special requests so we can make appropriate arrangements. Also, if anyone in your family would like to join, they are more than welcome to come along.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon with everyone. Let me know if you have any questions or need help with anything before the event.

Best regards,
Alice
