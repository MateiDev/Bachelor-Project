Hello Jane,

I hope you’re doing well! This is a friendly reminder about the Community Garden event scheduled for Saturday, August 3rd at 9:00 AM. We will be meeting at the Oak Street entrance of Maplewood Park. Activities include weeding, planting native flowers, and setting up the new compost bin.

We appreciate your help and energy. Please remember to bring water, gardening gloves, and sun protection. If you have any extra gardening tools you can lend, that would be fantastic but not required.

After the event, we’ll share snacks and refreshments under the pavilion. Feel free to invite any friends who might be interested in volunteering.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Sarah
