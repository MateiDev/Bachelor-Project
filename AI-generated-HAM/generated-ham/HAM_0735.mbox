Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about our upcoming weekend picnic at Lakeside Park.

So far, here's what I have in mind:
- Date: Saturday, March 16
- Time: Noon to 5 PM
- Location: North Pavilion, near the lakefront
- Food: I'll bring sandwiches, salads, and fruit.
- Drinks: I'll also bring bottled water and lemonade.

Could you please bring some snacks and maybe a blanket or two for seating? Also, let me know if you'd like me to reserve the pavilion.

Feel free to invite anyone else you'd like, and let me know if you have dietary restrictions. Looking forward to a fun afternoon outdoors!

Best regards,
Alice
