Hey Bob,

Are you still up for the hike this Sunday? The weather forecast looks great 
with clear skies and mild temperatures. I was thinking we could meet at 
8:00 AM at the trailhead parking lot near Pine Creek. Don't forget to bring 
water, snacks, and sunscreen.

Let me know if that works for you, and if you want to invite anyone else, 
feel free. Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
