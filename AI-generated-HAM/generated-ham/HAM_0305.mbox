Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on our team lunch plans for this Friday. The Italian Bistro downtown has a private room reserved for us at 12:30 PM. Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, and I'll make sure the menu accommodates everyone.

If Friday doesn't work, please suggest another day that fits your schedule. Otherwise, I'll send out calendar invites by the end of the day.

Looking forward to catching up with the team!

Thanks,
Alice
