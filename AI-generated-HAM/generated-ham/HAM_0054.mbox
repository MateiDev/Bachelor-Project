Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I'm writing to invite you to our July Book Club meeting, which will take place on Tuesday, July 20th at 7:00 PM at the Maple Community Center.

This month, we'll be discussing "The Night Watchman" by Louise Erdrich. It’s a compelling novel about heritage and perseverance, and I think you'll enjoy it.

Please let me know if you can make it. Feel free to bring a snack or beverage to share if you’d like.

Looking forward to catching up and chatting about the book!

Best regards,
Alice
