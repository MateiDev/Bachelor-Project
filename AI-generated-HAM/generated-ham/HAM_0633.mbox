Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to see if you’d be interested in joining a small group hike this Saturday at Blue Ridge Park. The trail is about 6 miles round-trip, with moderate elevation gain and some scenic overlooks. We plan to meet at the park entrance at 8:00 AM and return by early afternoon.

I’ll bring sandwiches, snacks, and plenty of water. Feel free to pack extra gear, like a camera or binoculars. The forecast calls for clear skies and mild temperatures—perfect for being outdoors.

Let me know if you’re up for it, and I’ll send you more details. Looking forward to spending some time on the trail!

Best,
Alice
