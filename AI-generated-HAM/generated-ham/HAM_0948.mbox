Hi Bob,

I hope you had a good week. I just wanted to touch base about two things:

1. Weekend Plans
   A few of us are planning a hike at Pine Ridge Trail this Saturday morning. We’ll meet at the trailhead around 8:30 AM. Feel free to join—we’re aiming for an easy-to-moderate route, and it should take about 3–4 hours. Let me know if you’d like to come along or if you need help arranging a carpool.

2. Project Update
   The draft of the quarterly report is almost complete. I’ve incorporated the sales figures and customer feedback analysis. Could you review sections 3 and 4 when you have a moment? Your insights on the new marketing metrics would be really helpful before we send it to management. I’m aiming to finalize the report by Tuesday afternoon.

Thanks, and enjoy your weekend!

Best,
Alice
