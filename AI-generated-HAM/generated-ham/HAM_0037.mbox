Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on the Q3 marketing campaign:

  1. Social Media Ads: The Facebook and Instagram ads are live as of yesterday. Initial engagement metrics are looking promising, with a 3.2% click-through rate on Facebook and 4.1% on Instagram.
  2. Blog Posts: Two new articles went up on the company blog this morning. One covers best practices for brand storytelling, and the other highlights our customer success story with GreenLeaf Co.
  3. Email Newsletter: We’ve drafted the August newsletter and it’s ready for your review. It includes the campaign highlights, a product feature spotlight, and a call for feedback.

Could you take a look at the draft newsletter by end of day Monday? Let me know if any edits are needed. Also, feel free to suggest any additional content you think would be valuable for our subscribers.

Thanks, and enjoy your weekend!

Best regards,
Alice
