Hello Team,

I hope everyone had a productive week. Here’s a quick update on our project milestones:

1. Front-End Module  
   - Completed the responsive layout for the new dashboard.  
   - Addressed user feedback on the color scheme.  

2. Back-End Integration  
   - Implemented API endpoints for user authentication.  
   - Fixed the data validation bug reported on Friday.  

3. Testing & QA  
   - Unit tests cover 85% of new code.  
   - Integration tests for payment processing are scheduled for Thursday.  

Next Steps:
- Coordinate with the DevOps team on deployment scripts.
- Review the database schema changes proposed by Sarah.
- Prepare documentation for the upcoming client demo.

Please reply with any blockers or questions by EOD Wednesday. Let’s aim to wrap up the remaining tasks before the weekend.

Best regards,
