Hi John,

Thank you for attending the quarterly sales meeting this morning. I wanted to share the summary of action items and next steps:

1. Sales Pipeline Update:
   - Each regional manager will submit their updated pipeline spreadsheet by Friday, July 23.
   - We’ll consolidate the data and distribute the combined report on Monday, July 26.

2. New Lead Generation:
   - Marketing will roll out the summer campaign starting August 1.
   - Please review the target accounts list and suggest any additions by July 22.

3. Training Session:
   - A product refresh webinar is scheduled for August 5 at 10:00 AM.
   - RSVP by replying to this email so we can reserve your seat.

4. Customer Feedback:
   - We received positive feedback from Acme Corp about the recent demo.
   - Let’s reach out to schedule a follow-up meeting in early August.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details. I’ll prepare the consolidated report once I receive everyone’s input.

Best regards,
Alexandra Johnson
