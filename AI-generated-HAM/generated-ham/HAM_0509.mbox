Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to check in about our hiking trip this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with a light breeze. I’ve mapped out a trail near Pine Ridge that’s about 8 miles round-trip, with some beautiful views along the ridge.

Here’s the tentative plan:
- Meet at my place by 7:30 AM
- Drive together to the trailhead (it’s about an hour away)
- Stop for a packed lunch at the overlook around noon
- Return by late afternoon for a quick coffee in town

Let me know if you need me to pick you up or if you’d like to carpool with someone else. Also, if you have any snack or gear preferences, just shoot me a quick reply.

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
