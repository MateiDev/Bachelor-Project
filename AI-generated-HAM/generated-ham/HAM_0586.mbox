Hello Bob,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to give you a quick update on the project timeline:

1. Initial design phase has been completed as of yesterday.
2. The development team is scheduled to begin coding next Monday.
3. We plan to conduct the first internal review by the end of the month.

Please let me know if you'd like to arrange a meeting to discuss any of these points in more detail or if you have feedback on the current plan.

Best regards,
Alice
