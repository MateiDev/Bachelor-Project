Hi Bob,

I hope your week is going well. A few team members suggested we organize a group lunch next Wednesday to celebrate the successful release of the Q2 report and to welcome our new colleagues. Would you be available around 12:30 PM?

I checked with the cafeteria, and they can reserve a table for up to eight people. If this time works for you, please let me know by Monday so I can confirm the booking. Also, feel free to share any dietary preferences or special requests.

Looking forward to catching up in a more relaxed setting!

Best regards,
Alice Smith
