Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to invite you to our annual summer potluck picnic next Saturday, July 4th, at Riverside Park from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM. It's a casual get-together with friends and family. We'll have sandwiches, salads, and plenty of cold drinks. If you have a favorite dish you'd like to share, please feel free to bring it alongâ€”homemade or store-bought works great.

There's a playground nearby for the kids and a large open field if anyone wants to play frisbee or soccer. Feel free to drop by anytime during those hours. Parking is free along Park Avenue, right next to the main entrance.

Let me know if you can make it, and if you plan to bring something to share. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying a relaxing afternoon together.

Best regards,
Alice
