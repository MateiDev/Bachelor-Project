Hi Bob,

Hope you’re doing well. Here’s the weekly update on Project Delta:

1. Feature Implementation  
   - The user login interface is now complete and has passed initial QA tests.  
   - John is finalizing the password recovery module, expected to wrap up by Wednesday.

2. Backend Integration  
   - We’ve integrated the new payment API endpoints. The sandbox is live, and test transactions are running smoothly.  
   - Maria will start load testing tomorrow and share the results by Friday afternoon.

3. Documentation  
   - I’ve drafted the initial user guide sections covering setup and basic usage. Feel free to review the /docs folder on the repo and leave comments.

4. Next Steps  
   - Begin UI/UX review sessions early next week.  
   - Prepare a demo for the client meeting scheduled on September 12th.

Please let me know if you need any clarifications or have additional items for the agenda. I’ll be out of the office Tuesday afternoon but reachable by email.

Best regards,
Alice
