Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. The marketing team is planning a team lunch next Friday, September 22nd, at 12:30 PM at The Green Bistro. We thought it would be nice to catch up outside the office and go over some informal ideas for our upcoming campaigns.

Please let me know if you can make it, and if you have any dietary restrictions we should consider when choosing the menu.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Alice
