Subject: Weekend Hike Plans

Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! The weather forecast for this weekend looks great, so I thought it would be the perfect time for our hiking trip. I was thinking we could try the Pine Ridge Trail—it’s about a 6-mile loop with some scenic overlooks and a creek crossing.

Here are a few ideas:
- Meet at the trailhead parking area at 9:00 AM on Saturday.
- Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sturdy shoes.
- I’ll pack a small first-aid kit and a fruit salad for everyone.
- If you have extra energy bars or light sandwiches, feel free to bring them.

Let me know if this works for you or if you’d prefer a different trail or time. Looking forward to getting out into nature and catching up!

Best,
Alice Johnson
