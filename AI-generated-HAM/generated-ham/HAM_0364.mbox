Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I'm organizing a picnic at Lakeside Park this Sunday at 11:00 AM. There will be sandwiches, fresh fruit, and lemonade. Feel free to bring anything you'd like to share. If you have any outdoor games like frisbee or cornhole, bring them along too.

Let me know if you can make it. It would be great to catch up and enjoy the sunshine together!

Cheers,
Alice
