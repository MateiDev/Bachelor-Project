Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check if you're available for a team lunch next Thursday at midday. A few of us are planning to try the new bistro downtown. If you have any dietary preferences or conflicts, please let me know by Tuesday.

Thanks, and looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
