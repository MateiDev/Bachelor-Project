Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up about our plans for the picnic this Saturday. Hereâ€™s a quick checklist of items we might bring:

- Sandwiches (I'll handle turkey and veggie)
- Fresh fruit (watermelon and grapes)
- Drinks (sparkling water and lemonade)
- Snacks (chips and mixed nuts)
- A folding table and some chairs
- Picnic blanket
- Sunscreen and a portable speaker

Let me know if you'd like to add or swap anything. The park gates open at 10:00 AM, and I was thinking we could set up near the lakeside area. If the weather looks doubtful, we can always move to the pavilion.

Looking forward to spending the afternoon outdoors!

Best,
Alice
