Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! The weather forecast looks great for this weekend, so I thought it would be fun to organize a small picnic at Riverside Park on Saturday afternoon.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Time: 12:30 PM
- Location: Near the pavilion by the river
- Menu: Sandwiches, fresh fruit, lemonade, and cookies
- What to bring: A blanket or lawn chairs, and maybe a frisbee or cards

Please let me know if you can make it, and if you’d like to contribute anything specific. Feel free to invite anyone else who might enjoy a relaxed afternoon outdoors.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Johnson
