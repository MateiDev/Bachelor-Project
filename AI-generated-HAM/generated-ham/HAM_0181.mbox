Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. This is a reminder about our upcoming Volunteer Day scheduled for Saturday, May 13th. We will be meeting at the Community Center at 9:00 AM and working together on the neighborhood cleanup and garden planting project.

Agenda:
- 9:00 AM: Meet in front of the Community Center (50 Maple Street)
- 9:15 AM: Briefing and safety instructions
- 9:30 AM – 12:30 PM: Cleanup and gardening activities
- 12:30 PM – 1:00 PM: Lunch break (please bring your own lunch)
- 1:00 PM – 3:00 PM: Final touches and tool cleanup

Please reply to this email if you plan to attend so we can arrange enough supplies and refreshments. If you have gloves or gardening tools you'd like to bring, that would be greatly appreciated. Wear comfortable clothing and closed-toe shoes.

Looking forward to seeing many of you there and making a positive impact on our community!

Best regards,
Alex Johnson
