Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The forecast looks great—sunny with mild temperatures. I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead at 8:00 AM on Saturday, July 3rd.

Here’s a rough plan:
- 8:00 AM: Meet at the Pine Ridge Trailhead parking lot
- 8:15 AM–12:00 PM: Hike up to the summit
- 12:00 PM–1:00 PM: Lunch at the summit (I’ll bring sandwiches and fruit)
- 1:00 PM–3:00 PM: Return hike
- 3:00 PM: Wrap up and head home

Let me know if that schedule works for you or if you’d prefer a different departure time. Also, please bring plenty of water, sunscreen, and a light jacket just in case the breeze picks up. I’ll pack an extra first-aid kit and some snacks.

Looking forward to the adventure!

Best,
Alice
