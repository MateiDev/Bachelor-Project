Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! With summer just around the corner, we’re starting to plan the annual company picnic, and I’m putting together a list of tasks and volunteers. Would you be available to help coordinate the food and refreshments this year? Last year’s potluck was a hit, but we could use someone to oversee the drinks and snack stations.

Here’s a draft schedule and task list:
- Venue reservations (pending)
- Potluck sign-up sheet
- Drinks and snacks coordinator
- Games and activities organizer
- Music and equipment setup

If you can take on the drinks/snacks role, please let me know by Wednesday so I can update the sign-up sheet. Feel free to suggest any new ideas—maybe a lemonade bar or a fruit skewer station?

Thanks for your help! Looking forward to making this year’s picnic our best one yet.

Best regards,
Alice
