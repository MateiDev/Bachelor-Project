Hello Bob,

Just wanted to check in and see if you're still up for hiking this weekend.
The weather forecast looks great for Saturday morning. I thought we
could meet at the trailhead by 8am and spend a few hours out in the
park. Afterwards, we could grab lunch at that new caf√© downtown.

Let me know if this works for you or if you'd prefer a different plan.
Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
