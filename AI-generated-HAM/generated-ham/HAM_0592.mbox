Hello Bob,

Hope you're doing well! I was thinking about our upcoming weekend hiking trip and wanted to nail down the details. The weather forecast looks great for Saturday morning, with temperatures in the mid-70s and clear skies. How does meeting at 7:00 AM at the trailhead near Pine Ridge Park sound?

I’ve packed some extra snacks and water, and I can bring a small first aid kit. If you have any specific gear you’d like to bring or any route preferences, let me know. Otherwise, I thought we could tackle the North Loop trail, which is about 8 miles and offers some great views from Eagle Rock.

After the hike, we could grab lunch at that new café downtown – I heard they have amazing sandwiches. Let me know what you think, and if Saturday morning works for you.

Looking forward to the adventure!

Best,
Alice
