Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder about our weekend potluck this Sunday at 5:00 PM at my place. Here’s what everyone has signed up for so far:

• Sarah – Vegetable platter  
• Michael – Assorted desserts  
• Priya – Fruit salad  
• Carlos – Soft drinks  

If you could bring your famous spinach dip, that would be wonderful! Also, feel free to drop by a bit earlier if you want help setting up.

Looking forward to seeing you and catching up. Let me know if you have any questions or need directions.

Best regards,
Alice

P.S. My address is 123 Maple Street, Apartment 4B. There’s parking available on the side street.
