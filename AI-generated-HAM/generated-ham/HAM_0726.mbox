Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! Now that the weather is finally warming up, I’d love to invite you to our annual Spring Potluck next Saturday, March 26th, at my place around 1:00 PM. We’ll have a mix of salads, grilled veggies, and desserts. Feel free to bring your favorite dish or beverage.

Let me know if you can make it and what you’d like to bring. We’ll have some lawn games and music, so it should be a fun afternoon.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Smith
