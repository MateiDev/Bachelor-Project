Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! It was great catching up last week. For this weekend, I was thinking we could go for a hike at Pine Ridge Trail on Saturday morning if the weather holds up. After the hike, maybe we could hit that new café downtown and try their seasonal pastries.

Also, I wanted to share a couple of books I've been enjoying recently:
1. "The Hidden Life of Trees" by Peter Wohlleben – fascinating insights into forest ecosystems.
2. "Educated" by Tara Westover – a powerful memoir about resilience and learning.

Let me know if you’re interested in joining the hike and if you’ve read any good books lately.

Have a great day!

Best,
Alice
