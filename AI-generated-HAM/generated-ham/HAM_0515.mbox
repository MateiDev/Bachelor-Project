Hi Jane,

Just wanted to share the finalized itinerary for our camping trip this Saturday. We'll meet at the trailhead at 8:00 AM and plan to set up camp by 1:00 PM near Lake Pine. I've attached the gear list and a grocery shopping list for the group. Let me know if you think of anything else we need.

Looking forward to some fresh air and good company!

Cheers,
John
