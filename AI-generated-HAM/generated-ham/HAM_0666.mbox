Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well. Thank you for attending yesterday’s project meeting. As discussed, I have summarized the key points and action items below:

1. Finalize the UI design by Friday.
2. Coordinate with the backend team to define the API endpoints.
3. Prepare the user test plan and share it by next Wednesday.

Please let me know if I missed anything or if you have any questions. I will be sending the meeting minutes later today.

Best regards,
John
