Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share the details for our upcoming weekend hiking trip in the Pine Ridge area.

Date: Saturday, September 19
Meeting Time: 8:00 AM
Meeting Point: Main trailhead parking lot (Pine Ridge Road)
Estimated Distance: 10 miles round trip
Difficulty: Moderate, with some steep sections

I’ve attached a printable map of the trail in PDF format for your reference. We’ll plan to take breaks at scenic overlooks and have a picnic lunch around midday. Please pack plenty of water, snacks, and sturdy boots. The weather forecast looks clear, but it’s always good to bring a light rain jacket just in case.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you’d like to carpool from my place. Looking forward to hitting the trails with you!

Best,
Alice
