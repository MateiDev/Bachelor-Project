Hey Bob,

Just a quick update on the Acme project:
- Completed the draft of the user requirements document.
- Sent the prototype to the design team for review.
- Scheduled a meeting with the stakeholders next Tuesday at 10 AM.

I also wanted to see if you’re free for lunch this Thursday. There’s a new café down the street that just opened, and I thought we could try it out around 12:30 PM.

Let me know if that works, and I’ll send a calendar invite.

Have a great day!

Cheers,
Alice
