Hi John,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to check in about planning our next team lunch. How does next Friday, July 30th, work for you? I was thinking we could try out the new bistro downtown—everyone’s been raving about their seasonal menu.

Please let me know if you’re free around noon or if another time suits you better. Also, if you have any dietary preferences or suggestions for other spots, feel free to share.

Looking forward to catching up outside of the office!

Best regards,
Jane
