Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check your availability for a lunch meeting next Thursday, March 9th. I have some updates to share regarding our quarterly project review, and it would be great to get your feedback in person.

Does 12:30 PM at Cafe Verde downtown work for you? If not, I'm flexible with other times or locations that week.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
