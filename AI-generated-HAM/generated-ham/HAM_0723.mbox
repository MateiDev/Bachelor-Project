Subject: Team meeting agenda and holiday party RSVP

Hi Sarah,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to send over the agenda for our team meeting next Tuesday at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B. We'll cover project updates, upcoming deadlines, and resource allocation. Please review the points below and let me know if you'd like to add anything:

1. Project Alpha progress report  
2. Q4 deliverables and timelines  
3. Staffing and support needs  
4. Budget review  

Also, our office holiday party is scheduled for December 10th at 6:00 PM at The Harvest Restaurant on Main Street. If you plan to attend, please let me know by November 20th so I can confirm the headcount.

Thanks, and have a great afternoon!

Best regards,
Michael
