Hello Team,

Apologies for the early email, but I wanted to share the agenda for our weekly project sync scheduled for Monday, July 17th at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B.

Agenda:
1. Project status updates (5 min. each)
2. Review of action items from last week
3. Discussion on upcoming milestones
4. Resource allocation for Q3
5. Open questions and next steps

Please review the project tracker before the meeting and update your tasks accordingly. Let me know if you have any additional topics you'd like to add to the agenda.

Thanks and have a great weekend!

Best regards,
Alice
