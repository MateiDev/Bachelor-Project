Subject: Summer Book Club Recommendations

Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! With summer here, I thought it might be fun to start a book club among friends. I'm considering these titles: "The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig, "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir, and "Klara and the Sun" by Kazuo Ishiguro. Let me know your thoughts or if you have other suggestions.

Also, if you're up for it, we can meet at the local coffee shop next Tuesday at 6 pm to discuss.

Best,
Alice
