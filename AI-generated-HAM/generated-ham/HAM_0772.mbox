Hello Team,

I hope everyone had a productive week. Here are a few updates and reminders:

1. The design mockups for Module A have been completed and are available in the shared drive (Designs/ModuleA).
2. QA testing for Module B is scheduled to begin next Monday. Please ensure all test cases are prepared by Friday.
3. We will have our regular stand-up meeting on Monday at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B.
4. If you have any blocking issues or need assistance, feel free to reach out before the end of the day Thursday.

Thank you all for your hard work. Letâ€™s keep up the momentum!

Best regards,
Alice
