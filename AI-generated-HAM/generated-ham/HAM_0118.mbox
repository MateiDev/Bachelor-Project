Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Just wanted to confirm our plans for the picnic this Saturday at Greenfield Park. I spoke with Carol, and she said she'd bring sandwiches and some drinks. I'll handle the fruit salad and snacks. We should aim to arrive around 11:00 AM to get a good spot near the lake.

Also, don't forget to bring a blanket or folding chairs and plenty of sunscreen. The forecast looks sunny with gentle breezes, so it should be a great day out. If you have any music playlists or outdoor games you'd like to bring, feel free!

Let me know if you have any questions or dietary preferences. Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
