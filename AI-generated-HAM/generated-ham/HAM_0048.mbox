Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on the Orion project:

  * We’ve completed the initial wireframes for the dashboard.
  * The backend API is 60% implemented; authentication and data endpoints are functional.
  * UX testing is scheduled for Tuesday morning; I’ll send out calendar invites later today.

Could we meet next Monday at 10:00 AM to review the wireframes and discuss next steps? Please let me know if that time works for you or if you’d prefer a different slot.

Thanks,
Alice
