Hi Team,

I hope you're all doing well. To celebrate the successful completion of the Delta project and to kick off Q2 with a positive start, I've reserved a table at Luigi's Italian Bistro this Friday, March 31st, at 12:30 PM. The restaurant is located at 123 Main Street, downtown.

Please let me know by Wednesday end of day if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, so I can update the reservation accordingly.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there and enjoying some good food and conversation!

Best regards,
Alice
