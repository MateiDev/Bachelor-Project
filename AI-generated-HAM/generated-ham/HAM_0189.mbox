Hi Bob,

Just a reminder that we have our weekly project meeting tomorrow at 10:00 AM in the main conference room. Here’s the proposed agenda:

1. Project status updates
2. Review of outstanding tasks
3. Timeline adjustments
4. Risk assessment and mitigation
5. Any other business

Please let me know if you’d like to add any items, or if you need to reschedule. I’ve attached the latest progress report to this email for your review before the meeting.

Looking forward to catching up and planning next steps.

Best regards,
Alice
