Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I’m organizing a team lunch next Wednesday (September 6th) at 12:30 PM at the new café down the street, The Green Bean. It’s a casual gathering so everyone can unwind after the project deadline.

Would you be able to join us? If so, let me know by Monday so I can confirm the reservation. Feel free to bring any dietary preferences to my attention, and I’ll make sure they’re accommodated.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone outside the office!

Best regards,
Alice
