Hello Bob,

Just a reminder that we have our team lunch scheduled for this Friday at noon at The Green Leaf on Main Street. If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, please let me know by Thursday so I can make reservations that accommodate everyone.

Additionally, if you have any topics or ideas youâ€™d like to discuss during our meeting, feel free to send them over beforehand or bring them along. This is a great opportunity for us to catch up on project progress and brainstorm the next steps.

Looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the team!

Best regards,
Alice
