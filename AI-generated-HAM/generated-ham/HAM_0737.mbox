Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our chat about getting together this Saturday to bake some treats. I found a great recipe for chocolate chip cookies that I think you'll love. Here are the ingredients:

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour  
- 1 tsp baking soda  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened  
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar  
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
- 2 large eggs  
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
