Agenda:
- Welcome and introductions (6:30 – 6:40)
- Discussion of key themes (6:40 – 7:20)
- Favorite passages and reflections (7:20 – 7:45)
- Next book selection and closing remarks (7:45 – 8:00)

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions for the light refreshments I’ll be providing. Also, if you’d like to nominate a book for our August meeting, feel free to reply with your suggestion by July 25th.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
