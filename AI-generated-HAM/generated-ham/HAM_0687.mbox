Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! It's been a while since we last caught up. I'm going to be in town next Tuesday (August 29th) and wondered if you'd like to grab a coffee at our favorite caf√© on 5th Avenue. My schedule is pretty flexible in the afternoon; let me know what time works for you.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Alice
