Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast for Saturday looks great—sunny with highs around 75°F. I checked the trail conditions online, and it seems the Pine Ridge Loop is clear of any closures or major mud spots.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM.
- Bring plenty of water (at least 2 liters), snacks, and a light lunch.
- Don’t forget sturdy hiking boots and a windbreaker, just in case it gets breezy.
- We’ll aim for the summit lookout point and then circle back via the river trail.

Let me know if that schedule works for you, or if you have any other ideas. Also, if you need a ride, I’ve got an extra seat in my car. Otherwise, feel free to meet me there.

Looking forward to hitting the trail!

Best,
Alice
