Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Just a quick reminder that our team lunch is scheduled for this Thursday at 12:30 PM at The Garden Bistro. We've reserved a table for 10, so if you know anyone else on the team who'd like to join, please let me know by Wednesday afternoon.

Also, if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, drop me a note and I'll make sure the restaurant can accommodate everyone.

Looking forward to catching up outside the office!

Best,
Alice
