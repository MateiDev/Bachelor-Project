Hello Team,

Just a friendly reminder that our office potluck is scheduled for this Friday at 12:30 PM in the main conference room. Please bring a dish to share—homemade or store-bought—and add your name and dish to the sign-up sheet on the break room bulletin board by Wednesday end of day.

We have slots for appetizers, main courses, sides, desserts, and beverages. If you need serving utensils or have any setup questions, let me know, and I’ll arrange them.

Looking forward to a delicious meal and great company! Thanks for participating.

Best,
Alice Johnson
Office Coordinator
