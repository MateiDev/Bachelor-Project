Hi Bob,

I hope you've been well. I wanted to see if you'd like to join me and a few friends for a hiking trip this weekend at Pine Ridge Trail. The plan is to meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM on Saturday. We'll probably be done by early afternoon. Please bring comfortable shoes, water, snacks, and sunscreen.

Let me know if you can make it. It will be a great opportunity to enjoy nature and get some fresh air.

Best,
Alice
