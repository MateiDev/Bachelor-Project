Hello Bob,

Just a friendly reminder that our weekly book club meeting is happening tomorrow evening at 7 PM in the Central Library’s meeting room B. We’ll be discussing “The Great Gatsby” this week.

Feel free to bring your copy of the book and any snacks you’d like to share. If you have any questions or need to reschedule, just let me know.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best,
Alice
