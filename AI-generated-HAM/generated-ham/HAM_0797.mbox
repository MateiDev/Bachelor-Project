Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to confirm our plans for the upcoming hiking trip this Saturday. Here's what I have in mind:

1. Meeting Point: Trailhead parking lot at Pine Ridge Park by 8:00 AM.
2. Route: We'll follow the East Ridge Trail (approximately 6 miles round-trip).
3. Supplies: 
   - Water (at least 2 liters per person)
   - Packed lunch/snacks
   - Sunscreen and hat
   - Comfortable hiking boots
4. Estimated Return: Around 2:00 PM, traffic permitting.

Let me know if this itinerary works for you or if youâ€™d like to make any changes. Also, if you have any specific dietary preferences, please share them so I can plan the lunch menu accordingly.

Looking forward to a great day outdoors!

Best,
Alice Johnson
