Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking plans for this Saturday. The forecast looks clear and cool, which should make for a great day on the trail.

I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:30 AM. I’ll bring sandwiches, snacks, and plenty of water. If you’d like, feel free to pack any extra gear—trail mix, fruit, or whatever you prefer. Don’t forget sturdy boots, layers, and a hat.

The route we discussed is about 6 miles round-trip, with a scenic overlook about halfway. It should take around 4–5 hours, including breaks for photos and lunch. Remember to bring your camera if you’d like to capture the view!

Let me know if this plan still works for you or if you’d like to adjust the timing. Looking forward to spending the day outdoors and catching up.

Best,
Alice
