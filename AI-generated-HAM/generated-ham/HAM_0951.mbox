Hi Bob,

Thanks again for joining yesterday’s team meeting. I’ve summarized the key points and next steps below:

1. Project Timeline Update  
   - Final draft due: August 5  
   - Review meeting: August 8 at 10:00 AM  

2. Marketing Material  
   - Sarah will provide the first mock-ups by next Tuesday.  
   - Design team to finalize layout by July 30.  

3. Budget Approval  
   - Finance needs the revised budget spreadsheet by July 25.  
   - I’ll follow up with Karen from finance this afternoon.  

Please let me know if I missed anything or if there are additional items to discuss. Otherwise, I’ll send the calendar invites for the upcoming meetings today.

Best regards,
Alice
