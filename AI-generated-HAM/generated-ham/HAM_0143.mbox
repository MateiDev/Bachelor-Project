Hey there,

I hope you had a great weekend! I wanted to share some highlights from our hike on Saturday up Pine Ridge Trail. The weather was perfect—sunny with a light breeze—and the wildflowers were in full bloom. We spotted a family of deer grazing near the creek, and the view from the summit was absolutely stunning.

After we reached the top, we took about 30 minutes to rest and enjoy our sandwiches. I brought along some homemade lemon bars, which everyone loved. On the way down, we discovered a small waterfall tucked away off the main path—it was a lovely surprise.

Let’s plan another outing soon. Maybe we could try the Lakeshore Loop next weekend if you’re free? Let me know your schedule, and we can sort out the details.

Talk soon,
Alex
