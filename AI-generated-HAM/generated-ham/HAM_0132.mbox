Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about the office potluck next Friday. I'm planning to bring a pasta salad with fresh basil and cherry tomatoes. Would you be able to bring dessert? Your lemon bars were a huge hit last time.

Also, the catering team needs our final headcount by this Friday, so please let me know if youâ€™ll be attending and if you have any dietary restrictions I should pass along.

Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you there!

Best,
Alice
