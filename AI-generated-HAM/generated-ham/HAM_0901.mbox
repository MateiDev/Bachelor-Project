Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I'm writing to confirm our plans for the weekend hiking trip. The trailhead meetup is set for Saturday at 8:00 AM, at the Pine Ridge parking lot. I'll bring extra water bottles and some snacks to share.

Please remember to wear sturdy shoes and bring a light backpack with your personal items. The weather forecast calls for sunny skies but cool winds in the afternoon, so layered clothing might be a good idea.

Let me know if you need a ride or if you have any dietary restrictions for the snacks. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Best,
Alice
