Hi Michael,

I hope you're doing well. The team is planning to go out for lunch next Monday, July 17th, at 12:30 PM. We thought "The Green Bistro" downtown would be a great spot â€“ they have vegetarian and gluten-free options too.

Could you let me know if you can make it? If not, feel free to suggest another time or place.

Best regards,
Emily
