Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As we discussed in the last meeting, our quarterly team lunch is scheduled for Friday, March 10th at noon. I'd like to finalize the menu by the end of the week.

Could you please review the following suggestions and let me know your preferences?

1. Mediterranean platter: hummus, falafel, tabbouleh, stuffed grape leaves  
2. Italian pasta bar: penne with marinara, fettuccine Alfredo, fusilli primavera, garlic bread  
3. Asian cuisine: vegetable spring rolls, chicken teriyaki, vegetable fried rice, miso soup  
4. Vegetarian options: quinoa salad, grilled vegetable skewers, fruit platter  

Additionally, if you have any dietary restrictions or special requests, please let me know.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
