Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Just a quick reminder that our annual team picnic is scheduled for this Saturday, June 8th, at Riverside Park. We'll meet at the main pavilion at 11:00 AM.

Here's the tentative agenda:
- 11:00 AM: Welcome and introductions
- 11:30 AM: Team-building activities
- 12:30 PM: Group lunch (potluck style)
- 2:00 PM: Friendly softball game
- 3:30 PM: Closing remarks and cleanup

Feel free to bring any games, blankets, or snacks you'd like to share. If you have dietary restrictions or need a ride, just let me know, and I'll be happy to help coordinate.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon with everyone!

Best,
Alice
