Hi Jane,

Hope you’re doing well. As discussed during yesterday’s meeting, we’re organizing our quarterly team lunch next Wednesday at noon in the main conference room. We’ll have sandwiches, salads, and a few dessert options. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences by end of day Monday.

Below is the draft agenda for the Q2 review meeting:
1. Project A status update
2. Budget review for Q2
3. Timeline and deliverables for Project B
4. Team feedback and open discussion

Feel free to suggest any additional items by tomorrow afternoon, and I’ll include them before sending out the final version.

Looking forward to catching up over lunch!

Best regards,
John Doe
