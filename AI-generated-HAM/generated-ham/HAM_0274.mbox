Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As discussed, we're holding the kick-off meeting for the Zenith project this Friday at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B.

Agenda:
- Introductions and roles
- Project timeline and milestones
- Resource allocation
- Communication plan
- Next steps and action items

Please review the agenda and let me know if youâ€™d like to add anything. Also, if you need any materials or have questions beforehand, feel free to reach out.

Looking forward to a productive session!

Best regards,
Alice
