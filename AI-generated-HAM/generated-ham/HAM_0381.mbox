Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to check if you’re up for a hiking trip this weekend.
The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with a light breeze—and I’ve found a trail
that goes around Lake Pinewood. It’s about 8 miles total, with some gentle climbs and
great viewpoints.

If you’re interested, we could meet at the trailhead Saturday morning around 8 AM.
I’ll bring snacks, water, and a simple first-aid kit. Feel free to pack a light lunch
and any gear you prefer (hiking boots, a hat, sunscreen, etc.).

Let me know if that works for you, or if you’d rather go Sunday instead. Looking
forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Cheers,
Alice
