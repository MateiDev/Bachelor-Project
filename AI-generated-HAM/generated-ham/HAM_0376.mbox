Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to remind you that our team lunch
is scheduled for this Friday at 12:30 PM at the new Italian bistro
downtown. I've reserved a table for 12 people, so feel free to invite
any colleagues who might be interested.

The restaurant address is:
La Trattoria
123 Main Street
Anytown, CA 90001

Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or special requests.
Looking forward to catching up over good food!

Best,
Alice
