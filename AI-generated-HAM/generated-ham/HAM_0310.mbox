Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! As we discussed, I’ve put together the details for our weekend hiking trip:

Date: Saturday, July 22nd
Meeting Point: Pine Ridge Trailhead parking lot
Time: 8:00 AM
Packing List:
 - Hiking boots
 - Water (at least 2 liters)
 - Snacks (trail mix, energy bars)
 - Sunscreen and hat
 - Light rain jacket
 - First aid kit
Route Plan:
We’ll follow the east loop of Pine Ridge Trail (approximately 7 miles round-trip). The terrain is moderate, with a few steep sections but plenty of scenic overlooks. We should be back by early afternoon.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need to adjust anything. Looking forward to hitting the trail together!

Best,
Alice
