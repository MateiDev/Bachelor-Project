Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well. I was thinking that with the nice weather coming up this weekend, it would be great to go hiking on the Blue Ridge Trail. The forecast looks clear and sunny, and the temperatures should be in the mid-70s.

Here’s what I have in mind:
- Departure: Saturday at 8:00 AM from the parking lot at Oak Ridge Park.
- Trail length: Approximately 10 miles, mostly moderate difficulty.
- Bring: Water, snacks, comfortable shoes, and a light jacket.

Let me know if you’re interested and if the time works for you. If anyone else wants to join, feel free to invite them. Looking forward to spending some time in the outdoors!

Best,
John
