Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! As summer is in full swing, I’m organizing a neighborhood potluck barbecue next Saturday, July 12 at my place. We’d love for you to join us.

Here’s the plan:
- Date: Saturday, July 12, 2024
- Time: 4:00 PM onwards
- Location: 123 Maple Street

Please bring a dish to share—salads, desserts, drinks, or anything you’d like. I’ll provide burgers, hot dogs, and some refreshments.

Let me know if you can make it and what you plan to bring so we can coordinate. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Johnson
