Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about our plans for the weekend hike.
As we discussed, we'll meet at the trailhead at 8:00 AM on Saturday. The forecast
looks sunny, with temperatures in the mid-70s, so it should be a beautiful day for
hiking.

I'll bring the map and a first-aid kit, and I can pick up some sandwiches on the way.
Let me know if you'd prefer a different meeting spot, or if you'd like me to bring
anything elseâ€”perhaps snacks or extra water bottles.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors together. See you soon!

Best,
Alice
