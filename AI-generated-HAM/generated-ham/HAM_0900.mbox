Hi Bob,

Are we still on for the hike this weekend? The weather forecast looks great, and I thought we could try the new trail at Pine Ridge Park. It's about a 5-mile loop with some nice viewpoints.

Would you like to meet at my place around 8:00 AM on Saturday? I can drive, or we can carpool with Sarah, who mentioned she wanted to join. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
