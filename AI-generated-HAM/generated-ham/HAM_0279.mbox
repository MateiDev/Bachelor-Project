Hi Bob,

I hope you're having a great week! I wanted to check in about our team lunch next week. The plan is to meet at The Garden Cafe on Wednesday at 12:30 PM. Let me know if that works for you or if you'd prefer a different day.

Also, please feel free to suggest any dietary accommodations so I can let the cafe know in advance.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
