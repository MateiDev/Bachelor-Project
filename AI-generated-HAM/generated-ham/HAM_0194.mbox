Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to check if you’re still up for the picnic next Saturday at Lakeside Park. The weather forecast looks perfect, and I was thinking we could bring some sandwiches, fruit, and maybe a board game or two.

Let me know if you have any dietary preferences or if there’s something special you’d like to bring. If 11:00 AM works for you, we can meet at the main pavilion near the east entrance.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
