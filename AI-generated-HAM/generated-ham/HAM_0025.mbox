Hi team,

I hope everyone is doing well. Our annual team offsite is scheduled for August 15th–17th, and I’d like to start gathering ideas for the agenda. Please share any workshop topics, team-building activities, or presentation requests you have by next Friday. We want to ensure the offsite is both productive and enjoyable for everyone.

Additionally, let me know if you have any venue suggestions or dietary requirements. Planning ahead will help us secure the best location and cater to all preferences. I’ll compile the responses and circulate a draft itinerary early next week for your feedback.

Thanks, and looking forward to your input!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
