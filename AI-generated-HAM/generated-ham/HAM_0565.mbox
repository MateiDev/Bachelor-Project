Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share the details for our weekend hiking trip:

- Meeting point: Pine Hill parking lot at 8:30 AM on Saturday.
- Trail: Lakeview Loop, approximately 6 miles.
- What to bring: water, snacks, sturdy shoes, and a light jacket.
- Estimated return: around 4:00 PM.

Let me know if you have any questions or need a ride. I’m looking forward to exploring the trails with you!

Best regards,
Alice
