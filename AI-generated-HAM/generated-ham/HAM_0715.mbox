Hello everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well. As summer approaches, it’s time to start planning our annual team picnic! Here are a few initial details:

Date: Saturday, August 3rd  
Time: 11:00 AM – 4:00 PM  
Location: Riverside Park, Shelter B  

Please let me know by Friday, July 19th if you and any family members will be attending, and if you have any dietary restrictions or activity suggestions. We’ll coordinate a potluck-style lunch, games, and a group photo.

Looking forward to spending a relaxing day outdoors with all of you!

Best regards,
John
