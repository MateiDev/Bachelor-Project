Hi Jane,

Just a quick reminder that our monthly book club meeting is coming up on Thursday, September 9th at 7 PM in the community center library (Room 204).
This month's pick is "The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig. Please bring your copy and any favorite passages or discussion questions you have.

Snacks and refreshments will be provided.

Let me know if you plan to attend or if you need any information about the venue.

Looking forward to another great discussion!

Cheers,
John
