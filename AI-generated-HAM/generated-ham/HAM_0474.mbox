Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! With the weather looking good this weekend, I thought it might be fun to organize a small picnic at Riverside Park. I’m thinking we could meet around noon on Saturday near the east entrance, bring some sandwiches, snacks, and maybe a frisbee or two.

Let me know if you’re interested and if you’d like to invite anyone else. I can pick up some lemonade and cookies on my way. If the park is too busy, we could also consider Greenfield Meadow—it’s usually quieter.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Alice
