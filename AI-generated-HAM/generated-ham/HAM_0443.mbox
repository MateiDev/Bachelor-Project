Hi Bob,

Here are the notes from yesterday's meeting on the project launch. Let me know if I missed anything:

- Finalize the design mockups by Friday.
- Confirm resource availability for the development team.
- Schedule the client demo for next Wednesday afternoon.

Please review and let me know your thoughts. We'll prepare the agenda for the next sprint planning session once these items are addressed.

Best regards,
Alice
