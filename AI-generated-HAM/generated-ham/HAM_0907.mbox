1. Welcome and introductions
2. Review of Q2 achievements
3. Project updates
   - Marketing campaign progress
   - Product development milestones
4. Budget review
5. Objectives and key results (OKRs) for Q3
6. Q&A and open discussion

Please let me know by Friday, July 19th if you have any additional items to add to the agenda or if you need to present specific updates. I will compile the final agenda and share the meeting materials by early next week.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
Alice
