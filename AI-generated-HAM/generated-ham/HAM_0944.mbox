Hi team,

I hope everyone had a great week! Here is the weekly update on our Product Launch project:

1. Design Phase
   - The final UI mockups have been approved by the stakeholders.
   - I've shared the design assets in the team drive: /Projects/ProductLaunch/Designs

2. Development
   - The frontend team completed the responsive layout for the homepage.
   - Backend integration for the authentication service is 80% done. We expect to wrap up by Tuesday.

3. QA & Testing
   - QA has begun smoke testing on the staging environment.
   - Please report any critical issues in the QA Jira board under the "Blocker" priority.

4. Next Steps
   - User acceptance testing scheduled for next Friday.
   - Marketing materials draft will be ready for review by Wednesday afternoon.

Action Items:
- Bob: Finalize the API documentation by Monday.
- Carol: Prepare the test cases for the payment module.
- Dave: Coordinate with the infrastructure team for the load testing setup.

Let me know if you have any questions or need assistance with your tasks.

Have a great weekend!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
