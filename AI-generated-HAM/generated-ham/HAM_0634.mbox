Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to confirm our plans for this weekend’s hike. The weather forecast looks great for Saturday morning—sunny with temperatures in the low 70s.

Here’s what I had in mind:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM.
- Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sunscreen.
- The route is about 5 miles round-trip, with a scenic overlook halfway.

Let me know if that time still works for you or if you'd prefer a different spot. If we finish early, we could grab lunch in town afterward.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
