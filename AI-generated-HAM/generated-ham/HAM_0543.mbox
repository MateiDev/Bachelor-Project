Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. As discussed in this morning’s stand-up, I’d like to arrange a team lunch this Friday, June 16th, at noon. I’ve made a tentative reservation at Bella Italia (123 Market Street). They offer a great selection of pastas and salads, and there’s ample space for us to sit together.

After lunch, I propose we head back to the office for a short brainstorming session on our next social media campaign. Please bring any ideas or sketches you have, and we can prioritize them as a group.

Could you all confirm your availability by tomorrow (Thursday) afternoon? If anyone has dietary restrictions or preferences, let me know so I can adjust the reservation.

Looking forward to seeing you all, catching up, and collaborating on some fresh ideas!

Best regards,
Alice
