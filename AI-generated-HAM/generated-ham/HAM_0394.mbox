Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder that our team lunch is scheduled for this Friday at noon. We'll be meeting at Luna’s Bistro on Maple Avenue. The restaurant offers a variety of options, including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes, so everyone should find something they like.

Please let me know by Wednesday end of day if you have any dietary restrictions or special requests. I’ll send a confirmation note to the rest of the team once I have everyone’s feedback.

Looking forward to catching up over lunch!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
