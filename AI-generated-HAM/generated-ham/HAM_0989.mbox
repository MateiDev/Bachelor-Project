Subject: Lunch Planning and Book Club Update

Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our lunch meeting tomorrow at 12:30 pm. Does the new café on Main Street still work for you? I’ve heard they have great sandwiches and a nice outdoor patio.

Also, our book club discussion is coming up next Friday. We’ll be talking about “The Night Circus” by Erin Morgenstern. If you’ve had a chance to finish it, feel free to share your thoughts ahead of time. We’re meeting at Carla’s place at 7 pm, and she’ll be providing coffee and snacks.

Let me know if any of those details need changing or if you have other suggestions.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
