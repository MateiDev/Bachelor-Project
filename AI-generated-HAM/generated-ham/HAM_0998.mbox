Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. As discussed in our last meeting, we’re planning a team picnic next Friday, June 21st, at Riverside Park. The picnic will start at 11:00 AM and run until about 3:00 PM. We’ve reserved the north pavilion, which has tables, grills, and open space for games.

Please let me know by Monday if you have any dietary restrictions or if you’d like to bring any specific dishes. We’ll coordinate a potluck-style menu so we can enjoy a variety of foods. If you have any ideas for activities—such as frisbee, cornhole, or board games—feel free to share them with the group.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon together!

Best regards,
John Doe
