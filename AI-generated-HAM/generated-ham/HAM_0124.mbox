Subject: Weekend Book Club Meeting

Hi Bob,

Just a quick reminder that our book club is meeting this Saturday at 3:00 PM at the community library downtown. We'll be discussing "The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig. Snacks and coffee will be provided.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the novel. Let me know if you have any questions or need directions.

Best regards,
Alice
