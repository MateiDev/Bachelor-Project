Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! The weather forecast looks great for this Saturday, so I’m planning to host a casual BBQ at my place around 2:00 PM. I’ll have burgers, veggie skewers, and drinks covered. Feel free to bring anything you’d like—salad, dessert, or your favorite beverage.

Let me know if you can make it. It would be wonderful to catch up and enjoy the afternoon outside.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Alice
