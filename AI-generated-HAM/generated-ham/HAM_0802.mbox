Hi Bob,

I hope you had a relaxing week! I wanted to share an update on the garden project we started last weekend. The raised beds are all assembled, and I’ve filled them with a mix of topsoil and compost. I transplanted the tomato seedlings today, and they’re looking healthy and strong.

Over the weekend, I plan to sow the basil and cilantro seeds along the edges to help deter pests and add some fresh herbs for the kitchen. I also picked up a couple of small trellises for the cucumbers—those should arrive on Saturday.

Let me know if you’re free Sunday afternoon; we could finish mulching around the beds and work on setting up the drip irrigation lines. It would be great to have your help, and we can celebrate with homemade lemonade afterwards!

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
Alice Johnson
