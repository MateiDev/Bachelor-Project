Hello Bob,

It's time to finalize our weekend picnic plans. The weather forecast looks great, with sunny skies and a gentle breeze. Here are the details:

- Date: Saturday, July 13
- Time: 11:00 AM - 4:00 PM
- Location: Willow Park, Pavilion 3

I'll bring sandwiches, fresh fruit, and lemonade. Could you please bring a few blankets and some games like frisbee or cards? If you have any dietary restrictions, let me know so I can accommodate them.

Looking forward to spending a relaxing afternoon outdoors! Feel free to reply with any suggestions or changes.

Best regards,
Alice
