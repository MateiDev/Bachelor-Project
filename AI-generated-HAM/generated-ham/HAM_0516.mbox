Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I was thinking about our plan to go hiking this weekend and wanted to nail down the details. The weather forecast for Saturday looks promising—sunny with temperatures in the mid-60s.

Here’s a rough itinerary:
- Meet at my place by 8:00 AM
- Drive to Pine Ridge Trailhead (about 45 minutes away)
- Start hiking by 9:00 AM
- Break for lunch around noon at the overlook
- Head back down by 2:00 PM to avoid afternoon crowds

Please let me know if this schedule works for you or if you’d prefer a different time. Also, feel free to invite anyone else from our group who might be interested. I’ll bring sandwiches, water, and trail snacks; just let me know if you have any dietary restrictions.

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best,
Alice Johnson
