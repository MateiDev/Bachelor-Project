Hi Bob,

Thanks again for leading yesterday’s project kickoff meeting. I’ve summarized the main action items below:

1. Finalize the design specs by Friday, June 7.
2. Coordinate with the marketing team for promotional materials.
3. Set up a draft timeline for development by mid-June.
4. Schedule a follow-up sync next Wednesday, June 12, at 10:00 AM.

Please review these items and let me know if anything needs adjusting. I’ll send calendar invites once we confirm the final dates.

Best regards,
Alice Smith
