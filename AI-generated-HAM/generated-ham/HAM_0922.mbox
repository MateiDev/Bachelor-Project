Hey Bob,

Just a quick reminder about our lunch meeting next Wednesday at 12:30 PM. Let’s meet at the new café downtown, “The Garden Table.” They have a great menu and a comfortable outdoor patio.

I’ve also drafted a preliminary agenda for our project discussion below. Feel free to review and suggest any additional topics.

1. Project timeline
2. Budget review
3. Resource allocation
4. Next steps

Looking forward to catching up.

Best regards,
Alice
