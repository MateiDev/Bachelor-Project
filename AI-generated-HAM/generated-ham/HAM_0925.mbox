Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Just wanted to check if you're free for lunch
next Tuesday, July 23rd. We can meet at the usual caf√© around noon.
Also, I'd like to give you a quick update on the Thompson project.
We've finalized the design mockups, and I'll bring the latest files
so you can review them.

Let me know if that works for you or if you'd prefer a different time.

Best,
Alice
