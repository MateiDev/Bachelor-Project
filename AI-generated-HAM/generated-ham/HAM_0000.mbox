Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to remind you about the community picnic we’re hosting this Saturday at Riverside Park. We’ll start setting up around 11:00 AM, and the potluck lunch will begin at noon. It would be great if you could bring your famous pasta salad, but feel free to bring anything you’d like to share.

We’ll have outdoor games, a small music setup, and plenty of space to relax. Kids and pets are welcome. If you have any folding chairs or a small cooler, please bring them along to help with seating and drinks.

Let me know if you need directions or have any dietary preferences we should consider. Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Alice
