Hey Bob,

Hope you’re doing well! I’ve been thinking about our conversation last week about getting outdoors. The weather forecast for Saturday looks perfect—sunny with a high of 75°F—and I was wondering if you’d like to join me for a day hike at Pine Ridge Trail.

Here’s what I’m proposing:
  * Meet at my place around 8:00 AM.
  * Drive together to the trailhead (about a 45-minute drive).
  * Hike for roughly 5–6 miles round trip.
  * Pack a picnic lunch to enjoy at the overlook.

I’ll bring a cooler with sandwiches, fruit, and plenty of water. Feel free to bring any snacks you like, plus a camera if you want to capture the views. Also, don’t forget sturdy shoes, sunscreen, and a light jacket in case it gets breezy up top.

Let me know if this works for you or if you’d prefer another date or trail. Looking forward to catching up and getting some fresh air!

Best,
Alice
