Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. The team is planning a casual lunch next Wednesday at 12:30 PM
to celebrate the completion of our quarterly report. We're thinking of meeting
at the new caf√© around the corner, "Sunny Side Bistro."

Would you be able to join us? If you have any dietary preferences or
restrictions, please let me know by Monday so I can make reservations.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
