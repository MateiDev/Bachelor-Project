Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I'm writing to confirm our plans for the hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks greatâ€”sunny with mild temperatures. Here's the tentative schedule:

- Saturday, 8:00 AM: Meet at the trailhead parking lot.
- 8:15 AM: Begin the hike on Pine Ridge Trail.
- 12:30 PM: Lunch break at Maple Grove.
- 1:30 PM: Resume hiking toward Summit Peak.
- 4:00 PM: Return to trailhead.

Please remember to bring:
- Plenty of water (at least 2 liters).
- Snacks or a packed lunch.
- Sunscreen and a hat.
- Sturdy hiking shoes.

Let me know if the timings work for you or if you'd like to adjust anything. Also, feel free to invite anyone else who might be interested. Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best,
Alice Johnson
