Hi everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well. Now that summer is just around the corner,
I thought it would be a great idea for us to plan a team picnic in
the park. It would be a nice opportunity to relax, get to know each
other better, and enjoy some good food.

Here are a few initial thoughts:
- Date: Friday, July 12th, around noon
- Location: Lakeside Park (Shelter #3)
- Activities: Frisbee, board games, and a short nature walk
- Food: Potluck style – please sign up to bring something

Please reply with your availability for July 12th and let me know what
dish you’d like to bring. If you have any other suggestions for
activities or location, feel free to share.

Looking forward to some fun in the sun!

Best,
Alex
