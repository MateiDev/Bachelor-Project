Hi Emily,

I hope you're doing well! As we discussed in yesterday’s meeting, the team is planning a casual lunch this Friday at noon. We’re thinking of trying the new Italian deli down the street—La Bella Cucina. They have great pasta and vegetarian options.

Could you let me know by Wednesday if you can join? Also, if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, feel free to mention them so I can reserve enough dishes.

Looking forward to catching up outside the office.

Best,
Steve Johnson
