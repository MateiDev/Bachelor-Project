Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to let you know that we're planning a team lunch
next Friday, August 2nd, at 12:30 PM. The location will be the new bistro downtown,
The Olive Tree. It's just a short walk from the office, and they have a variety of
salads, sandwiches, and vegetarian options.

Please let me know by Tuesday if you can make it so I can confirm the reservation:
- Yes, I'll be there
- Sorry, I'll be out of office

Also, feel free to suggest any other spots if you prefer something different. Looking
forward to spending some time together outside the office.

Best regards,
Alice
