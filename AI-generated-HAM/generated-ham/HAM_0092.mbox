Hello Bob,

Hope you’re doing well! This is just a quick reminder about our team potluck this Saturday at 1 PM in the break room. Here’s the list of dishes so far:

- Cheese and crackers (Julia)
- Veggie platter (Mark)
- Fruit salad (Sarah)

Could you bring your famous deviled eggs? Let me know if you need any serving utensils or dishes returned afterwards.

Also, if you think of any games or activities we could do during the potluck, feel free to share your ideas.

Looking forward to seeing everyone!

Best,
Alice
