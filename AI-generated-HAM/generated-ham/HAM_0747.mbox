Hello John,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to remind you about the potluck picnic this Saturday in Riverside Park. We'll be gathering at the picnic tables near the west entrance at 11:00 AM. Feel free to bring any dish you enjoy making—appetizers, salads, main courses, desserts, or drinks. We already have a few volunteers signed up for sandwiches and fruit platters, but there’s plenty of room for more.

I'll bring my famous chocolate chip cookies, and Sara is planning to bake some savory quiches. If you could let me know what you'll bring by Thursday evening, that would be great, so we don't end up with too many duplicates.

The weather forecast looks perfect for a day out: sunny with a light breeze and temperatures in the low 70s. Don’t forget to bring a blanket or folding chair, and maybe sunscreen if you need it. We'll also have some outdoor games like frisbee and bocce ball, so feel free to join in!

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying a relaxing afternoon with friends.

Best regards,
Jane

Hi Jane,

Thanks for organizing this! I’ll bring my grandmother’s potato salad—it’s always a crowd favorite. I might also whip up a batch of lemonade if that sounds good. Let me know if we need any extra utensils or plates; I can bring a few sets.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon.

Cheers,
Michael
