Hi Bob,

Are you free for lunch tomorrow at our usual spot downtown? Let me know if that works for you or if you'd prefer somewhere else. Also, I wanted to mention that the report on the Thompson account is almost done; I'll send it over by the end of the day tomorrow.

Have a great afternoon,
Alice
