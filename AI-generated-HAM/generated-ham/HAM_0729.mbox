Hi Bob,

Our team has decided to go for lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM. Weâ€™ll meet at the lobby and head over to The Bistro on Elm Street. Please let me know by Thursday whether you can make it, so I can reserve a table.

Also, feel free to suggest any dietary preferences or favorite dishes.

Best regards,
Alice
