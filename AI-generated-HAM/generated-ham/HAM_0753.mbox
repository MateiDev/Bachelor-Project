Hello Bob,

Here's the weekly update for the Greenfield project:

1. Completed the database schema review.
2. Initial UI mockups are ready for stakeholder feedback.
3. We scheduled a meeting with the design team on Thursday at 2 PM.
4. The API integration tests have begun and are ~50% complete.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss any of these items in more detail. Otherwise, I'll proceed with drafting the project timeline for next week.

Best,
Alice
