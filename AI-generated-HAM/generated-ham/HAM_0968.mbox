Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about heading out for a hike this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with mild temperatures in the mid-70s.

Here’s what I'm thinking:
  * Meet at the trailhead parking lot at 9:00 AM.
  * The Pine Ridge Loop is about 6 miles, moderate difficulty.
  * Pack plenty of water, snacks, and sunscreen.
  * Wear comfortable hiking shoes and a hat.

After we finish the hike, we could stop by the lakeside café for a light lunch. I heard they have a new seasonal menu with berry tarts and iced tea. Let me know if that works for you or if you’d prefer a different route or time.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some fresh air!

Best,
Alice
