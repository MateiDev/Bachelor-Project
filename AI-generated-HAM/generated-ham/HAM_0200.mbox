Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. I wanted to check in regarding our team lunch next week.

I have narrowed it down to two options:
1) The Italian Bistro on Elm Street – they have a gluten-free menu.
2) Sakura Sushi Bar – their bento boxes are quite popular.

Could you let me know which one you prefer by Friday? Also, if there are any dietary restrictions I should be aware of, please mention them.

Looking forward to your reply!

Best regards,
Alice
