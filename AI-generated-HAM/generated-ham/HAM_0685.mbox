Hi John,

Hope you’re doing well. Here’s the agenda for our lunch meeting next Tuesday:

1. Project status updates
2. Budget review for Q3
3. New marketing campaign ideas
4. Any other business

Please let me know if you’d like to add anything else. Looking forward to our discussion!

Best regards,
Jane
