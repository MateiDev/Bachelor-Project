Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to see if you're still interested in joining
the hiking trip this Saturday. The trail I'm planning is about 8 miles long, with
some moderate elevation change. The weather forecast looks sunny with mild
temperatures.

We'll meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM. Please bring plenty of water,
snacks, a hat, and sunscreen. Let me know if you need a ride or if you'll be driving
separately.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors.

Best regards,
Alice
