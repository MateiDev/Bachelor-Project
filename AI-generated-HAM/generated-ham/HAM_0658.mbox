Hello Team,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m excited to invite everyone to our Annual Team Picnic on Saturday, February 18th, at Riverside Park. It will be a relaxed afternoon of games, food, and good company. Here are the details:

Date: Saturday, February 18, 2023
Time: 11:00 AM – 3:00 PM
Location: Riverside Park, Pavilion B
What to Bring: A side dish or dessert to share, and a picnic blanket or lawn chair.

We’ll provide sandwiches, soft drinks, and bottled water. If you have any dietary restrictions, please let me know by Friday, February 10th, so we can make appropriate accommodations.

Feel free to bring your families and significant others. We’ll have frisbees, board games, and a small volleyball net set up. If you’d like to volunteer to help with setup or cleanup, please reply to this email.

Looking forward to a fun day together outside the office!

Best regards,
Alice Smith
