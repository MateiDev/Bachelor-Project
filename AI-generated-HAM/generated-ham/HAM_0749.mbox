Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to arrange a team lunch next Wednesday at noon.
The team has been working hard lately, and I thought it would be nice to get together
outside the office. Let me know if you're available, and if you have any restaurant
preferences.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
Alice
