Hi Bob,

Are you still up for the hike this weekend? I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead at 9:00 AM on Saturday. I'll pack some sandwiches, fruit, and plenty of water.

Let me know if that time works for you or if youâ€™d prefer to start a bit earlier. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the great outdoors!

Cheers,
Alice
