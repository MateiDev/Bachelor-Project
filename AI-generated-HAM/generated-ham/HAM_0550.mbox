Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I've attached the first draft of the quarterly report for your review.
Please take a look at the financial summary section on pages 2â€“4 and let me know if any figures need adjustment.
I also highlighted the key performance indicators in bold for easier reference.

Let me know if you have any questions or would like to set up a meeting to go over the details.
I'll be available all next week except for Wednesday afternoon.

Best regards,
Alice
