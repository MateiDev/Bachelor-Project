Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing to reschedule our Monday 10:00 AM team meeting. Would Tuesday at 2:00 PM work for you instead? If not, please let me know your availability later this week.

I’ve also attached the draft agenda for our next project discussion—feel free to review it and suggest any additional topics.

Thanks and looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Johnson
