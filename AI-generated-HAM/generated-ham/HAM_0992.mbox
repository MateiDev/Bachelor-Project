Hey Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! Just wanted to confirm our plans for this Saturday. I’m thinking we could meet at the trailhead at 9:00 AM, bring along some sandwiches and snacks for a picnic at the summit, and then head back down by mid-afternoon. The forecast looks perfect—sunny but not too hot.

I’ve packed fresh fruit, cheese, and a loaf of sourdough. If you can bring drinks and maybe some cookies, that’d be great. Let me know if you need me to pick anything up on my way.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the view. See you then!

Cheers,
Alice
