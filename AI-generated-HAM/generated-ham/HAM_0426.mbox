Hi Alice,

I hope you’re doing well! It’s that time of year again—we’re kicking off plans for the annual Office Spring Picnic. Here are the details we need to confirm:

1. Date and Time
   - Proposed date: Saturday, April 15
   - Time: 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM

2. Location
   - Lakeside Park, Shelter #4
   - Parking is available at the north lot

3. Food and Beverages
   - We’ll arrange sandwiches, salads, and vegetarian options.
   - Would you mind coordinating drinks? We’ll need both non-alcoholic and a small selection of beer.

4. Activities
   - Frisbee, cornhole, and a group scavenger hunt.
   - We’ll bring speakers for light music.

5. RSVP
   - Please let me know by Friday, March 10.
   - We’ll finalize headcount and dietary requirements after that.

For reference, I’ve uploaded the initial planning document to our intranet:

Feel free to suggest any other ideas or adjustments. Thanks in advance for your help!

Best,
Bob
