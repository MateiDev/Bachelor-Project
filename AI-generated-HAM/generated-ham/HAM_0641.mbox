Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! The weather forecast for this weekend looks great, so I was thinking about going for a hike on Saturday morning. There's a new trail at Pine Ridge Park that I'd like to exploreâ€”it's supposed to have some beautiful overlooks.

Would you be interested in joining? We can meet at my place around 8:00 AM, grab some coffee on the way, and head out by 8:30. The trail is about 5 miles long with moderate difficulty, and I expect we'll be back by early afternoon.

Let me know if that works for you. Feel free to bring extra snacks or water if you'd like. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Best,
Alice
