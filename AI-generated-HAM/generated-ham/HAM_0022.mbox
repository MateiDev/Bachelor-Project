Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to remind you about our summer picnic this Saturday at Lakeview Park. We’ll be meeting around 11:00 AM by the main pavilion. Feel free to bring a dish to share—I'm planning to make my famous pasta salad.

If the weather turns, we can move to the indoor shelter nearby, so no worries there. Also, let me know if you’d like to carpool; I have a couple extra seats in my car.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the sunshine together!

Best,
Alice
