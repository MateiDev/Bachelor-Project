Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I’ve been looking forward to our weekend hike and wanted to finalize the details. Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. Meeting Point: Pine Ridge Trailhead at 8:00 AM on Saturday.
2. Trail Length: Approximately 5 miles loop, moderate difficulty.
3. What to Bring:
   - Water (at least 2 liters)
   - Snacks or a light lunch
   - Sunscreen and hat
   - Comfortable hiking shoes
4. Weather: Forecast looks sunny with a high of 75°F.

Let me know if you have any other suggestions or if the time works for you. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

See you soon,
