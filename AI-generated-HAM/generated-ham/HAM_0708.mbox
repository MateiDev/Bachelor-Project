Hi Bob,

Hope you've been well! I'm planning a backyard barbecue this Saturday afternoon
and would love for you to join. We'll fire up the grill around 3 PM. Feel free
to bring anything you'd like to throw on the grill or a side dish to share.

The kids can play in the yard, and we're setting up some lawn games as well.
Let me know if you can make it, and I'll send over the address details.

Looking forward to hanging out!

Best,
Alice
