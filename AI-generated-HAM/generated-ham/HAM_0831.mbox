Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. It’s been a busy few weeks, and I thought it would be great to catch up over lunch. Are you available next Thursday, July 22nd, around noon? We could try that new café on Maple Avenue that just opened—it has great reviews.

I’d also like to discuss the upcoming project timeline and get your input on resource allocation. No rush on formal materials; just a relaxed conversation to make sure we’re aligned before we dive into the next phase.

Let me know if that works for you or if another time is better. Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
