Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to remind you about our family gathering this Saturday at my parents' house.
We'll have a potluck lunch starting around noon, and feel free to bring your famous potato salad!
Mom has also asked if you could bring your guitar to play some tunes in the afternoon.

Let me know if you're able to make it or if you need any directions.
Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best,
Alice
