Hi Bob,

As you know, our annual team picnic is this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great, with a high of 78Â°F and sunny skies. We will meet at Elm Park at 11:00 AM by the main pavilion. Please bring a side dish or beverage to share with the group. I've volunteered to bring sandwiches and bottled water.

Let me know if you need directions or want to coordinate a carpool. It should be a fun afternoon catching up outside the office.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best,
Alice
