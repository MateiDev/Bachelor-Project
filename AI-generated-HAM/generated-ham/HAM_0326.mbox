Hi Alice,

I hope you’re doing well! Just a quick note to remind you about our team lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM. We’ll be meeting at the café on 5th Street, right next to the park.  

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences so I can give the café a heads-up. If you’d like to carpool, I’ll be leaving the office around 12:00 PM, and there’s room for two more people in my car.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best,
Bob
