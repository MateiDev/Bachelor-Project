Hi everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well. As we wrap up the current sprint, I wanted to share the agenda for our planning meeting next Tuesday, July 16th, at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B (and via Zoom for remote attendees).

1. Sprint Retrospective
   - What went well
   - Challenges and bottlenecks
   - Action items for improvement

2. Backlog Review
   - Prioritize user stories for the next sprint
   - Estimate effort (story points)

3. Resource Allocation
   - Team availability (vacations, holidays)
   - Assignments based on expertise

4. Technical Discussion
   - Proposed changes to the deployment pipeline
   - Code review best practices

5. Q&A and Open Floor

Please review the current backlog in Jira and add any comments or estimates before the meeting. If you have additional agenda items, send them to me by Monday EOD so I can update the meeting invite.

Looking forward to a productive session. Thanks for all your hard work!

Best regards,
Alice
