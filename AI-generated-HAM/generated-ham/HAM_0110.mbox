Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I'd like to schedule a team lunch next Wednesday, July 17th, at 12:30 PM. I found a nice place called "The Garden Bistro" downtown that offers vegetarian and vegan options.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if another day works better for you. Once everyone confirms, I'll make a reservation.

Looking forward to catching up with you all outside of the office.

Best regards,
Alice
