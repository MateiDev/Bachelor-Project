Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. The team and I are planning a lunch outing next
Wednesday (March 22nd) at 12:30 PM at the new Italian bistro downtown,
“La Trattoria.” It would be great if you could join us.

Please let me know by Friday if you’re available so I can make
reservations. If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences,
feel free to mention them.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
