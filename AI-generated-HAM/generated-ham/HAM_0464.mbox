Hi Bob,

Just a quick note to confirm our team lunch next Wednesday at Noon.  
We're meeting at The Green Garden Café on Elm Street. I’ve reserved a table  
for six under “Johnson.” Let me know if you need to adjust the time or if  
you’d like to invite anyone else from the marketing team.

Also, Jill mentioned she has a new vegan dish she wants us to try—sounds  
exciting! If you have any dietary preferences, please send me a quick reply  
by Tuesday afternoon so I can update the reservation.

Looking forward to catching up outside the office.

Best,
Alice Johnson
Senior Marketing Coordinator
