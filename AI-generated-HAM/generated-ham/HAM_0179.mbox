Hi Bob,

I hope you’ve been well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about organizing a weekend hiking trip next month. The weather should be perfect for escaping the city, and I found a couple of trail options that look promising:

1) Pine Ridge Loop – A moderate 8-mile loop with scenic overlooks and a creek crossing around mile 4.  
2) Willow Falls Trail – A shorter 5-mile out-and-back route ending at a small waterfall.  

Both trails have nearby campsites if we decide to turn this into an overnight adventure. Let me know which one you prefer, or if you have any other suggestions. If everyone’s available, we could plan to leave Friday evening (July 28th) and return Sunday afternoon.

Please check your calendar and share your thoughts by next week so I can reserve any permits or campsites if needed. I’ll draft a tentative schedule once we pick a trail.

Looking forward to getting out on the trails!

Best regards,
Alice Smith
