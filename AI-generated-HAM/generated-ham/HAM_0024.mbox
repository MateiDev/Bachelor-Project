Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to remind you about our next book club meeting on Thursday, July 18th at 6:30 PM at the Lakeside Community Center. We'll be discussing "The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig.

Please let me know if you can make it and whether you'd like to bring some snacks or refreshments. Also, feel free to suggest any other books for future meetings.

Looking forward to catching up and hearing your thoughts on the novel.

Best regards,
Alice
