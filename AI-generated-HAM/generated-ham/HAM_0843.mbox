Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! The team has been talking about organizing a casual outing next Friday, October 29th, after work. We’re thinking of grabbing dinner at The Green Bistro downtown around 6:30 PM, followed by board games at Sarah’s house nearby.

Could you let me know if you’re available? If you have any dietary preferences or game suggestions, feel free to share them. It should be a fun, low-key evening to unwind and catch up outside of the office.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Alice
