Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, we’re scheduled to review the Q2 budget next Tuesday at 2:00 PM in the main conference room. I’ve uploaded the preliminary budget report to the Finance folder on the shared drive for your review.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional data before the meeting. I’ll confirm the room booking and send a calendar invite by end of day Monday.

Thanks,
Alice
