Hi Bob,

Just a quick reminder about our team outing next Friday, June 23rd. We’ll be meeting at the office at 11:00 AM and heading to Lakeside Park for a picnic and some outdoor games. Lunch will be catered by Sunny’s Cafe, and they have vegetarian and gluten-free options if you let me know by Wednesday.

Please RSVP by Tuesday so I can confirm the headcount. If you have any questions or need a ride, feel free to reach out.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon!

Best,
Alice Smith
