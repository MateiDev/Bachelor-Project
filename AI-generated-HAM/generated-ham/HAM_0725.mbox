Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to remind everyone about our team lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM. We’ll be meeting at The Corner Bistro on 5th Avenue. Please confirm if you can make it so I can finalize the reservation.

Also, here’s a brief update on the current project status:

- Design phase: Completed last week
- Development: 60% done, on track for next milestone
- Testing: Scheduled to start in two weeks
- Documentation: Drafts are in the shared drive

Let me know if you have any questions or if there are additional topics you’d like to discuss at the lunch meeting.

Thanks,
Alice Johnson
