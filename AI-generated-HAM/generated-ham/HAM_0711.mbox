Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well! The weather forecast looks great for this weekend, so I’m planning a casual BBQ at my place on Saturday afternoon. I’m thinking around 2 PM. There will be burgers, hot dogs, veggie skewers, and a few sides—feel free to bring anything you’d like to share, like a dessert or a salad.

It’ll be a small gathering: just a few neighbors and friends. Kids and pets are welcome, so bring Emma if she wants to join. We’ve got some outdoor games lined up (cornhole, frisbee) and a speaker for music.

Let me know if you can make it and if you have any dietary preferences. Looking forward to catching up!

Cheers,
Alice Johnson
