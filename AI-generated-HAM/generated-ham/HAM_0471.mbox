Hi Bob,

Just wanted to confirm our plans for the weekend hike. The weather forecast is looking great for Saturday.
Shall we meet at the trailhead at 8:00 AM? I can bring some sandwiches and snacks.
Let me know if that works for you, or if you'd prefer a different meeting time.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
