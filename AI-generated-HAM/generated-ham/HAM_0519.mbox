Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Just wanted to check in about our plans for this weekend. I was thinking we could go hiking at Eagle Rock on Saturday morning, weather permitting. Let me know if that works for you or if you have other ideas.

Also, if you have time on Sunday afternoon, there's a new art exhibit opening downtown that looks interesting. We could grab lunch first and then head over.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
