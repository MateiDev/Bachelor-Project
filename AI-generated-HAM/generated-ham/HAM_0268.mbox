Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our weekend plans. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with highs around 75°F. I checked the trail map for Pine Ridge Park, and there’s a scenic overlook about 5 miles in that has some amazing views.

Here's the tentative schedule:
- Saturday, 8:00 AM: Meet at my place for coffee and snacks.
- 8:30 AM: Drive out to Pine Ridge Park (about 45 minutes).
- 9:30 AM: Start the hike on the Ridge Loop Trail.
- 12:00 PM: Stop for lunch at the overlook (I'll pack sandwiches and fruit).
- 1:00 PM: Continue on the Oak Creek branch, then loop back.
- 4:00 PM: Estimated return to the parking lot.
- 4:30 PM: Grab a cold drink at the park café before heading home.

Let me know if that works for you, or if you’d prefer a different start time. Also, if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, just shoot me a quick note. I’m planning to pack extra water and some trail mix, but feel free to bring anything special you like.

Looking forward to catching up and getting some fresh air!

Best,
Alice Smith
