Hi Bob,

I hope you're having a great week! We're planning a team lunch next Wednesday, March 22, at 12:30 PM. We'll be meeting at The Corner Bistro on Maple Street. I've looked at the menu, and they offer a good variety of salads, sandwiches, and pasta dishes.

Could you please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences? For example, vegetarian, gluten-free, or any allergies. If you have a favorite dish from their menu, feel free to mention that as well.

Looking forward to catching up outside the office.

Best regards,
Alice
