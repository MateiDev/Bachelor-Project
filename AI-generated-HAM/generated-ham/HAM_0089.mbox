Hi Jane,

I'm planning a small potluck this Saturday evening at my place. It would be great if you could make it. Feel free to bring a dish or a beverage of your choice.

Here's the plan:
- 6:00 PM: Guests start arriving
- 7:00 PM: Dinner
- 8:30 PM: Board games
- 10:30 PM: Movie screening

Let me know what you'll bring, so we can coordinate. I'm thinking of making my mom's lasagna, and I'll provide drinks and dessert.

Address:
123 Maple Street
Apt 4B
Springfield, IL 62704

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
John
