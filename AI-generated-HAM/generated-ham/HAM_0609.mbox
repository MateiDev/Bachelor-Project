Hello Bob,

I hope this finds you well. I wanted to finalize our plans for the hiking trip this weekend.

I've reserved a campsite at Pine Ridge Campground for Saturday night. Let me know if that works for you and if you'd like to bring anything special for dinner. I'm planning to pack a portable grill and make some burgers and veggie skewers.

The trailheads are about 15 miles from the campground. We could start with the River Loop trail in the morning and then tackle Sunset Peak in the afternoon. The total distance is around 10 miles, with moderate elevation gain.

If you have any suggestions or prefer a different route, just let me know. Also, don't forget to bring plenty of water, snacks, and layers. The forecast shows sunny skies during the day but cooler temperatures in the evening.

Looking forward to exploring the trails with you!

Cheers,
Alice
