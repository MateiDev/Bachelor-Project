Hi John,

I hope you're doing well. The team and I were thinking about organizing a casual lunch next Tuesday to celebrate the successful wrap-up of Project Phoenix. Weâ€™re planning to meet at the cafe on 5th Avenue around 12:30 PM.

Could you let me know if that works for you? Also, feel free to share any dietary preferences or other suggestions for the menu. We'd like to make sure everyone is comfortable and has something they enjoy.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Jane
