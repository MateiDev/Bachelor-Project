Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Just a friendly reminder that our next Summer Book Club meeting is scheduled for Thursday, September 21st at 7:00 PM in the Community Room at Central Library.

We'll be discussing "The Southern Reach Trilogy" by Jeff VanderMeer. Feel free to bring snacks or drinks to share. If you have any questions or need to reschedule, just let me know.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Alice
