Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. With summer just around the corner, I thought it would be fun to organize a weekend hiking trip to Pine Ridge Trail. It’s about a two-hour drive from the city, and the trail offers scenic views of the lake and surrounding forests.

Here’s a rough itinerary:
- Saturday morning (8:00 AM): Meet at my place and carpool
- 10:00 AM: Arrive at Pine Ridge Trailhead, gear check
- 10:30 AM – 2:00 PM: Hike to Lake Vista; lunch by the water
- 2:00 PM – 4:30 PM: Return hike
- 5:00 PM: Head back home

Feel free to let me know if you'd prefer a different schedule or if you have any other trail suggestions. Also, don’t forget to bring plenty of water, sunscreen, and sturdy hiking shoes. If anyone else wants to join, just send me their names so I can arrange carpooling.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
Alice Johnson
