Hello Bob,

Just a friendly reminder about our monthly book club meeting coming up next Thursday, September 7th, at 7:00 PM. We'll be meeting at the Riverside Community Center in the main conference room.

This month we're discussing "The Night Circus" by Erin Morgenstern. Feel free to bring snacks or beverages to share. We usually start with a brief recap, then dive into discussion with some prepared questions, followed by open discussion.

Let me know if you have any questions or need directions. Hope to see you there!

Best,
Alice Johnson
