Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder about our family picnic this Sunday, July 15th, at Riverside Park. We'll start around 11:00 AM near the south pavilion. Please bring a side dish or dessert to shareâ€”don't forget to label any dishes containing nuts.

Here's a quick list of what others are bringing:
- Mom: Fried chicken
- Uncle Mike: Potato salad
- Aunt Sarah: Lemon bars
- Cousin Jenna: Fresh fruit

Let me know if you'd like to borrow any outdoor games or chairs. Looking forward to a fun day together!

See you soon,
Alice
