Hi Bob,

Thanks again for meeting with me for lunch yesterday at The Corner Cafe. It was great to catch up and discuss our plans for the upcoming community workshop.

As promised, I've drafted an outline of the session topics and projected timeline. Please find the outline below:

1. Introductions and icebreakers (10 minutes)
2. Presentation on recent community projects (20 minutes)
3. Small group brainstorming sessions (30 minutes)
4. Break (10 minutes)
5. Group presentations and feedback (20 minutes)
6. Next steps and action items (10 minutes)

Let me know if you have any suggestions or if you'd like to adjust the time allocations. Once we finalize the outline, I can reserve the meeting room at the downtown library and send out invitations to our volunteers.

Looking forward to your thoughts. Have a great day!

Best regards,
Alice
