Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. As discussed in last week’s meeting, we’re organizing a team building activity on Friday, March 15th, from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM at the Lakeside Retreat Center. The agenda includes:

1. Ice-breaker games to help everyone get to know each other.
2. A collaborative problem-solving challenge.
3. A light lunch and refreshments.
4. A short debrief to gather feedback and suggestions.

Could you please confirm:
- Your availability for the full session.
- Any dietary restrictions or special accommodation needs.
- If you’d like to lead one of the ice-breaker games (feel free to let me know which one).

I’ll compile everyone’s responses by Tuesday, March 12th, so we can finalize the schedule and catering order. Let me know if you have any questions or additional ideas.

Looking forward to a fun and productive afternoon!

Best regards,
Alice
