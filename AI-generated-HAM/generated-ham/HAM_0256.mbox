Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to confirm our plans for the family reunion dinner next week.
As discussed, let's meet on Saturday, June 29th, at 6:30 PM at Mom's house (123 Maple Street).
I'll bring the homemade apple pie you love, and Dad will handle the barbecue.

Please let me know if you need any help getting there or if you'd prefer to contribute a dish
instead. Also, feel free to invite anyone else in the family who might not have received
the invitation yet.

Looking forward to catching up and seeing everyone.

Best regards,
Alice
