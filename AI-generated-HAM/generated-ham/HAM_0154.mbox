Hi Bob,

I hope you’re having a great weekend. I wanted to share a quick update on the Apollo project:

1) Prototype Completion
   – The initial hardware prototype is now fully assembled.
   – QA testing starts next Monday.

2) Design Review
   – I’ve uploaded the latest schematics and PCB layouts to the shared drive.
   – Please review them by Wednesday, August 2nd.

3) Marketing Materials
   – Maria is finalizing the brochure draft.
   – We’ll have a team call on Thursday at 2:00 PM to discuss.

Can you confirm your availability for the review meeting on Wednesday? Also, let me know if you need any additional documentation.

Thanks, and enjoy the rest of your weekend!

Best regards,
Alice
