Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share the final details for our weekend hiking trip in the Pine Ridge area.

Date: Saturday, June 22, 2024
Meeting Time: 8:00 AM
Meeting Point: Pine Ridge Trailhead Parking Lot
Expected Return: Late afternoon (around 5:00 PM)

Please remember to bring:
- Comfortable hiking shoes
- Water (at least 2 liters)
- Snacks or a packed lunch
- Sunscreen and a hat
- Light rain jacket (just in case)

I’ve attached a PDF with the trail map and parking instructions. Let me know if you have any questions or need a ride.

Looking forward to hitting the trail with you!

Best,
Alice
