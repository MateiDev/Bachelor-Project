Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our plan for the weekend hiking trip. The forecast looks clear with sunny skies and temperatures around 72°F. I’ve already packed my gear and reserved the campsite at Pine Ridge for Saturday night.

Here’s the itinerary:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM on Saturday.
- Hike up to Eagle’s View Overlook (approximately 5 miles).
- Set up camp around 2:00 PM and relax by the lake.
- Sunday morning, we’ll hike the Ridge Loop trail (3 miles) before heading back to the car by noon.

Please let me know if you need me to bring anything extra—tent stakes, cooking utensils, or first aid supplies. Also, if your plans change and you can’t make it, just give me a heads up by Friday evening.

Looking forward to a great adventure!

Best,
Alice
