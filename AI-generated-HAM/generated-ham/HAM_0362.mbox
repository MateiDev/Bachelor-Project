Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. With summer in full swing, I’d like to organize a casual team lunch next Friday, June 21st, at 12:30 PM. I’ve made a reservation at The Riverside Bistro, which offers a varied menu and outdoor seating by the river.

Please let me know by Wednesday if you can join, so I can confirm the headcount. If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, include those in your reply. Looking forward to some time together outside the office!

Best regards,
Alice
