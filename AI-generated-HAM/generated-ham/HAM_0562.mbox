Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to let you know that I’m organizing a team outing next Friday,
July 5th. We’re planning to meet at 5:00 PM at Riverside Park for a picnic, followed by a casual
kickball game. Feel free to bring any snacks, drinks, or games you’d like.

Let me know if you can make it, and if you have any dietary restrictions or suggestions for
activities. It should be a fun opportunity to relax and hang out outside of work.

Best,
Alice
