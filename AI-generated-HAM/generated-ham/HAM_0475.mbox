Dear Book Club Members,

I hope you’re all doing well. This is a friendly reminder that our next Book Club meeting will be held on Tuesday, March 15, at 7:00 PM in the Community Library’s conference room on the second floor. We’ll be discussing Chapters 4 through 7 of “The Great Gatsby,” so please be sure to bring your copy and your thoughts on the characters’ motivations and the symbolism you’ve noticed.

Agenda:
- Welcome and introductions (7:00 – 7:10)
- Discussion of Chapters 4–7 (7:10 – 8:00)
- Break with refreshments (8:00 – 8:15)
- Open discussion and future book suggestions (8:15 – 8:45)

If you’d like to contribute a small snack or beverage for our break, feel free to let me know in reply to this email. Also, if anyone needs a ride, please mention that in your RSVP and we’ll try to coordinate carpool arrangements.

Please reply by Friday evening to confirm your attendance. I look forward to seeing everyone and hearing your insights!

Warm regards,

Alice Smith  
Book Club Coordinator
