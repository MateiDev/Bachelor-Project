Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! The weather for this Saturday looks perfect—sunny with a light breeze. I was thinking it would be a great day for a picnic at Riverside Park. We could meet around noon near the main entrance.

I'll bring sandwiches, fruit, and some lemonade. If you’d like, feel free to bring anything you enjoy—chips, cookies, or a salad. Also, don’t forget a blanket or folding chairs if you have them.

Let me know if that works for you, or if you have another spot in mind. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Johnson
