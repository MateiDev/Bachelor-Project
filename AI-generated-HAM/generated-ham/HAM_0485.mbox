Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Here are the details for our upcoming weekend hiking trip in the Blue Ridge Mountains:

  * Departure: Saturday, May 6 at 7:00 AM from the trailhead parking lot
  * Route: Pine Hill Trail to Sunrise Peak (approximately 8 miles round trip)
  * Gear: Please bring a daypack, sturdy hiking boots, waterproof jacket, and plenty of water (at least 2 liters). Don't forget energy bars or trail mix for snacks.
  * Lunch: We'll stop at the summit for a picnic around noon—I'll pack sandwiches and fruit.
  * Weather: The forecast calls for partly cloudy skies with highs near 68°F, so layers should be sufficient.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to carpool separately. Looking forward to exploring the trails with you!

Best regards,
Alice
