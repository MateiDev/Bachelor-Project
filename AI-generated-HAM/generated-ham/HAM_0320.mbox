Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to share our quarterly progress on the Orion project:

1. Research Phase Complete
   - Competitive analysis finalized
   - User interviews conducted with 15 participants

2. Design Mockups In Progress
   - Home screen and dashboard drafted
   - Awaiting feedback from UX team

3. Upcoming Tasks
   - Prototype development starting July 20
   - Internal review scheduled for August 5

Please let me know if you'd like a walkthrough of the designs or have any suggestions before we move into development. I'll prepare a brief slide deck for our next meeting.

Thanks,
Alice Johnson
