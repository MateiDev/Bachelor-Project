Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Just a quick reminder that our annual team picnic is coming up this Saturday at Riverside Park. We'll meet at Shelter 3 around noon, and the event will run until about 4 PM. Feel free to bring any outdoor games or sports equipment you'd like.

Here's a brief agenda for the day:
- 12:00 PM: Arrival and setup
- 12:30 PM: Welcome remarks and lunch
- 1:30 PM: Group games and activities
- 3:00 PM: Free time / socializing
- 4:00 PM: Wrap-up and clean-up

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or special needs so I can plan accordingly. We're providing sandwiches, salad, and beverages, but you're welcome to bring a dish to share if you like.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon together. See you on Saturday!

Best regards,
Alice
