Subject: Team Lunch and Project Update

Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m reaching out to confirm our team lunch next Wednesday at 12:30 PM. The reservation is at Olive Garden on Main Street. Please let me know if you have any dietary preferences or if that time doesn’t work for you.

Also, I wanted to share a brief update on the Q2 marketing project:

- Final draft of the campaign brochure is 90% complete.
- Social media calendar has been scheduled through mid-June.
- We’ve proposed two new blog topics and are awaiting feedback from the content team.

Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to discuss before the lunch meeting. Looking forward to catching up in person!

Best regards,
Alice
