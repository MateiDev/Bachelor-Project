Hi Bob,

Thanks again for meeting with the team this morning. Here's a quick recap of what we discussed:

- Project timelines: We agreed on a preliminary schedule for phases 1 and 2.
- Resource allocation: Jane will handle design, while Tom and I will focus on development.
- Next steps: 
    1. Finalize the requirements document by Friday.
    2. Set up the project repository.
    3. Schedule the kickoff call for next Tuesday.

Please let me know if I missed anything or if you have additional comments.

Best regards,
Alice
