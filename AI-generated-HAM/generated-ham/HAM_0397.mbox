Hi John,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check in about our plans for the weekend hike. The weather forecast for Saturday looks great—sunny with temperatures in the mid-70s. I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead at 9:00 AM. That should give us plenty of time to complete the 6-mile loop before noon.

I also packed sandwiches, fruit, and plenty of water. Feel free to bring any snacks or drinks you like. If you’d like to carpool, I can pick you up at your place around 8:15 AM. Just let me know what works best.

Looking forward to seeing you and enjoying some time in the outdoors!

Best,
Jane Doe
