Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! As we discussed at the last team meeting, we’re planning a summer picnic for next month. Here are a few details:

Date: Saturday, August 17th
Time: 11:30 AM – 3:00 PM
Location: Riverside Park, Pavilion #3

Could you please:
1. Confirm if you can bring the outdoor games equipment.
2. Let me know how many people from your department will attend.
3. Suggest any additional items we might need (e.g., folding chairs, coolers).

I’ll handle the food and beverages. If you have any dietary preferences or special requests, just let me know by next Friday (July 31st).

Looking forward to a fun afternoon outdoors!

Best regards,
Alice
