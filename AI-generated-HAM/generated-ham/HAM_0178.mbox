Hi Alice,

Thanks for participating in today's team meeting. Our main action items were:

- Draft the project proposal by next Tuesday.
- Schedule a review session with the stakeholders.
- Gather feedback on the initial UI mockups.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need help with any of these tasks.

Best regards,
Bob Smith
