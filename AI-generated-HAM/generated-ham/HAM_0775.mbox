Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! The weather forecast for this Saturday looks perfect for hiking, with clear skies and mild temperatures. I was thinking we could revisit the Pine Ridge trail—it's around 7 miles, has that lovely stream crossing, and the wildflowers should be in bloom by now.

If you're up for it, let's meet at my place around 8:00 AM. We can carpool from there; I’ll bring extra water bottles and some trail snacks. I also found a new spot near the summit where we can stop for lunch and enjoy the view. Feel free to bring anything special you’d like to share—homemade granola bars, fruit, or even a thermos of hot chocolate.

After the hike, we could swing by that little bakery on Maple Street for some coffee and pastries. They have a new sourdough almond croissant that I’m eager to try. Let me know if Saturday works for you and if you have any dietary preferences.

Looking forward to hitting the trail together!

Best,
Alice
