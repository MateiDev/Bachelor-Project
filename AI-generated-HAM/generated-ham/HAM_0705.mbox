Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check in about organizing our team lunch next week.
Based on everyone's availability, how does Wednesday, July 3rd at noon sound to you?
We can meet at the new bistro downtown.

Let me know if that works, or if you'd prefer another day. I'll also send a calendar invite once
we've confirmed the details.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
