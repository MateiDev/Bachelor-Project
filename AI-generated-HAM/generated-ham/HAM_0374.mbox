Hi Bob,

Just wanted to confirm our plans for the hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks great: sunny with mild temperatures. Here is what I suggest:
- Meet at the trailhead at 8:00 AM on Saturday.
- Bring plenty of water, snacks, and a light lunch.
- Wear sturdy hiking boots and a hat.
- We can try the new waterfall overlook trail that opened last month.

Let me know if that works for you or if you prefer a different schedule. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some fresh air!

Best,
Alice
