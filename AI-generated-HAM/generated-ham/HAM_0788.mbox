Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to remind you about our team luncheon scheduled for next Friday, July 30th, at 12:30 PM in the main cafeteria. We’ll have a variety of dishes available, including vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Please let me know by end of day Tuesday if you have any dietary restrictions or special requests, so I can finalize the catering order. We’re also planning a short presentation afterward to review our accomplishments this quarter and outline goals for the next.

Looking forward to a great event and catching up with everyone.

Best regards,
Alice
