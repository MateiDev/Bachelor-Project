Hi Bob,

I hope you're having a good week. Are you free for lunch this Friday? I was thinking we could try the new cafe on Maple Street—they have great sandwiches and a cozy atmosphere.

Let me know if that works for you or if you’d prefer another spot. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Johnson
