Hi Bob,

Just wanted to touch base about our hike this weekend at Pine Ridge trail. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with a mild breeze. I plan to start at the trailhead around 8:00 AM on Saturday. Would you like to carpool? I can pick you up at your place around 7:30 AM.

Also, I’ve packed some snacks—granola, fruit, and sandwiches. Let me know if you have any preferences or if you’d like to bring anything. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Best,
Alice
