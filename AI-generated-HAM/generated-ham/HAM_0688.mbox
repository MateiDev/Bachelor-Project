Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm planning my vegetable garden layout this weekend and wanted to share my ideas to get your input. Last year, we tried growing tomatoes in the raised beds near the fence, but they didn't produce as many as I had hoped. This time, I'm considering moving the tomato plants to the south side, where they will receive more sunlight throughout the day.

I also bought seeds for basil, parsley, and cilantro. I thought it would be fun to have fresh herbs on hand. Do you remember if you preferred the basil in pots or directly in the bed? I want to maximize space, so maybe pots would be better.

Additionally, the weather forecast looks warm and dry, so I'll need to set up an irrigation schedule. Would you be interested in helping me install a drip system this Saturday afternoon? I can provide lunch and some freshly baked scones.

Let me know your thoughts when you have a chance.

Best,
Alice Smith
