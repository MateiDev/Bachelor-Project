Hi John,

I hope you're doing well. As we discussed in last week's meeting, I'm putting together a proposal for our next
team building activity. Here are a few ideas:

1. Outdoor scavenger hunt in Central Park.
2. Cooking class at The Culinary Workshop downtown.
3. Volunteer day at the local community garden.

Please let me know which option you prefer, or if you have any additional suggestions. I'd like to finalize
the details by the end of next week so we can send out the invites.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
