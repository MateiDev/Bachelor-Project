Hi Bob,
I'm really excited about our hiking trip this weekend! Here are the details:
- Date: Saturday, October 9
- Meeting Point: Pinewood Trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM
- Trail: Lakeview Summit Trail (approx. 6 miles round trip)
- Difficulty: Moderate

Please make sure to bring:
* Sturdy hiking boots
* Water (at least 2 liters)
* Snacks and a packed lunch
* Rain jacket (just in case)

Let me know if you have any questions or if the time/place doesn't work for you.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
