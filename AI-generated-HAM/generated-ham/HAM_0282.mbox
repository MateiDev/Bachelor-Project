Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! With the weather looking great this Saturday, I thought it might be fun to organize a small picnic at Greenway Park. I’m thinking of meeting around 11:30 AM near the main pavilion. 

Here’s a rough plan:
- I’ll bring sandwiches, fresh fruit, and lemonade.
- Could you bring some snacks or desserts? Whatever you like best.
- If you have a portable speaker, feel free to bring it for some background music.
- I can bring a blanket, but if you’d rather bring one, that’s perfect too.

Let me know if you’re available and if you have any dietary preferences or suggestions for the menu. It would be great to catch up and enjoy the sun!

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Alice
