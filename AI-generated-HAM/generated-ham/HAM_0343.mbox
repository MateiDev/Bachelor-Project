Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As discussed in yesterday's meeting, we're planning a team lunch this Friday at the new caf√© downtown. It's scheduled for 12:30 PM, and everyone from the marketing and development teams has been invited.

Additionally, I'd like to give you a brief update on our Q2 project. The initial design mock-ups are almost complete, and the UX team will share the first draft by tomorrow afternoon. Once we have their feedback, we can move forward with the prototype phase.

Could you please confirm your attendance for the lunch and let me know if you have any dietary restrictions? Also, feel free to share any comments on the mock-ups once they arrive.

Looking forward to catching up.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
