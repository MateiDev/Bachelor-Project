Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share the details for our hiking trip this weekend:

Date: Saturday, March 18
Meeting Time: 8:00 AM
Meeting Point: Lakeview Trailhead Parking Lot
Trail Length: Approximately 7 miles, moderate difficulty
Estimated Return: Around 4:00 PM

Weather looks sunny but cool, so dress in layers and bring plenty of water and snacks. I’ll pack some granola bars and fresh fruit, and we can divvy up other supplies like sandwiches and trail mix. If you have any preferences or dietary restrictions, just let me know.

Also, don’t forget your camera—the views from the ridge are spectacular! We should have time afterward to grab a bite at the cafe down the road if you’d like.

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors. Please confirm that you’re all set, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Cheers,
Alice Johnson
