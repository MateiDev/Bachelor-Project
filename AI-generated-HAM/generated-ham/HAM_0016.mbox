Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! As we discussed in our last meeting, it’s time to start planning our quarterly team outing. I’ve outlined a few ideas below:

1. Outdoor picnic at Riverside Park – weather permitting, we can rent a pavilion and have a catered lunch.
2. Escape room challenge – a fun way to build teamwork and problem-solving skills.
3. Cooking class – hands-on experience with a local chef, followed by a group dinner.

Please let me know which option you prefer or feel free to suggest any other activities. If we can decide by the end of this week, I’ll go ahead and secure the reservations.

Thanks, and looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Best regards,
Alice
