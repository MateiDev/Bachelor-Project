Hey Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! Just wanted to touch base about our weekend plans. The weather forecast for Saturday looks great—sunny with temperatures in the mid-70s. I’m thinking we could meet at the Pine Ridge trailhead around 8:30 AM. That should give us plenty of daylight for the 7-mile loop.

I’ve packed a cooler with sandwiches, fruit, and plenty of water. Feel free to bring any snacks or gear you’d like—maybe some trail mix or granola bars. Don’t forget sunscreen and a hat; the trail sections along the ridge get a lot of sun exposure.

After the hike, there’s that new café in town that I’ve been meaning to try. They have great cold brews and homemade pastries. It might be a nice spot to relax and catch up before heading home.

Let me know if that works for you or if you’d prefer a different time. Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
