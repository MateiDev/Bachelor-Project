Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! The weather forecast for next Saturday looks perfect, so I thought it would be a great time for that picnic we talked about. I'm thinking of meeting at Riverfront Park around noon. I'll bring sandwiches, fresh fruit, and lemonade. Could you bring some snacks or maybe a few blankets?

Let me know if that works for you or if you have any other ideas. Feel free to invite anyone else who might enjoy joining us.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
