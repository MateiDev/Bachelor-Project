Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! As discussed during yesterday’s meeting, we’re planning a team outing next Friday, February 23rd. We have a few options on the table:

1. Bowling and pizza at StrikeZone.
2. A nature hike at Pinecrest Park followed by a picnic lunch.
3. Escape room challenge downtown.

Please let me know your preference by Monday so I can finalize the booking. If you have any other ideas, feel free to share them.

Looking forward to a fun team event!

Best,
Alice
