Hey Bob,

Looking forward to our hiking trip this weekend! I’ve mapped out a route to Eagle Peak that’s about 8 miles round trip. We’ll start early Saturday to avoid the afternoon heat. Don’t forget to pack plenty of water, snacks, and a light jacket—the summit can get chilly.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or if you need a ride to the trailhead. I’ll pick you up at your place around 7:00 AM.

Cheers,
Alice
