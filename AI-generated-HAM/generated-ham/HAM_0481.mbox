Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! As discussed in our last meeting, we're organizing a casual team outing this Friday after work. Here are the details:

Date: Friday, July 16th  
Time: 5:30 PM  
Meeting Point: Lobby of the headquarters building  
Activity: Bowling and pizza at Kingpin Alley  
Duration: Approximately 2 hours, followed by optional drinks at The Corner Bar

Please let me know by Wednesday afternoon if you can join so I can confirm the reservation and pizza order. Feel free to suggest any dietary preferences or alternative activities if you have other ideas.

Looking forward to a fun evening with the team!

Best regards,
Alice
