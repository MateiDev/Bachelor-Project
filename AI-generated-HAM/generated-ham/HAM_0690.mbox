Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! As we discussed in last week’s meeting, we're planning a summer team outing next Friday, July 21st. Here are the details:

Venue: Lakeside Park Pavilion  
Time: 11:30 AM – 3:00 PM  
Activities:  
 - Picnic lunch catered by The Green Deli  
 - Frisbee and volleyball  
 - Nature walk along the lake trail  

Please let me know by Tuesday if you have any dietary restrictions or special requests so I can inform the caterer. Feel free to bring family members or a plus-one if you'd like.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon outside the office. Let me know if you have any questions!

Best regards,
Alice
