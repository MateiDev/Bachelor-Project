Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! It’s time to start organizing our annual summer picnic. Here are a few items we need to discuss:

1. Date and Time: Should we aim for the weekend of July 20th or July 27th? Let me know your availability.
2. Location: Last year’s park was a hit. Do you think we should book the same spot, or try the lakefront picnic area?
3. Food and Drinks: I can handle sandwiches and salads. Could you coordinate beverages and snacks?  
4. Activities: We had the volleyball net and frisbees last year. Are there any new ideas you’d like to suggest?
5. RSVP List: I’ll send out invites once we finalize details. Please send me a list of any special dietary needs.

Feel free to add any other notes or suggestions. Let’s aim to finalize everything by next Tuesday so we can reserve the spot before it fills up.

Thanks, and talk soon!

Best,
Alice Johnson
