Hi Bob,

Here's the tentative agenda for our weekly team meeting next Monday:

1. Project status updates
2. Upcoming milestones and deadlines
3. Resource allocation review
4. Feedback and open discussion
5. Action items and next steps

Please let me know if you'd like to add any additional points.

Thanks,
Alice
