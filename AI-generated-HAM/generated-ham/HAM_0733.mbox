Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. Here are the details for our weekend hiking trip:

Meeting Point:
  • Pine Valley Trailhead parking lot
  • Saturday, August 6 at 8:00 AM

What to Bring:
  • Daypack with water reservoir (at least 2 liters)
  • Trail snacks (nuts, granola bars)
  • Lightweight rain jacket
  • Hat and sunglasses
  • First-aid kit
  • Camera or phone for photos
  • Comfortable hiking boots

Route:
  We’ll start on the Pine Valley Loop, which is about 10 miles round trip. The trail climbs gradually and offers great views of the river valley. We’ll take a break at Eagle Rock overlook around noon, then head back the same way.

Lunch Plans:
  I’ll pack sandwiches for everyone (vegetarian option included). If you have any dietary preferences, let me know by Friday morning.

Weather Forecast:
  Sunny with a high of 75°F and light breeze. No rain expected.

Let me know if you have any questions or if anything changes. Looking forward to a fun day on the trail!

Best,
Alice Johnson
