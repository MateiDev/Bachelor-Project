Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing to share the agenda for our team meeting on Thursday:

1. Review of last quarter’s performance metrics
2. Project timeline updates for the new marketing campaign
3. Feedback from the design team on the recent prototype
4. Resource allocation for upcoming events
5. Open discussion and action items

Please let me know if you’d like to add any topics or if you have questions about the current items. Also, if you could send a brief update on your progress with the social media analytics report by Wednesday, that would be great.

Thanks, and I look forward to catching up on Thursday.

Best regards,
Alice
