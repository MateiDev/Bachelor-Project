Hey Bob,

Are you still interested in joining the hiking trip this weekend? I found a great trail up near Pine Creek that’s about 8 miles round trip with some scenic overlooks. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with mild temperatures. I was thinking of leaving early Saturday morning around 8:00 AM. We can carpool from my place, pack a lunch, and maybe stop at that diner on the way back.

Let me know if you’re in, and I’ll send you the detailed route and meeting spot. Looking forward to it!

Cheers,
Alice
