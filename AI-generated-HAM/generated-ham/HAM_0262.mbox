Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m writing to confirm our plans for the weekend hike at Pine Ridge Park. The weather forecast looks great, with sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-60s.

Here’s the tentative schedule:
- Saturday, 8:00 AM: Meet at the trailhead parking lot.
- 8:15 AM: Start the East Loop (about 6 miles).
- 12:30 PM: Lunch break near the creek.
- 1:15 PM: Continue on the West Spur to the overlook.
- 3:30 PM: Return to the trailhead.

I’ll bring a small first-aid kit, some trail snacks, and a map of the area. Could you please bring the refillable water bottles and your camera? Don’t forget to wear sturdy shoes and dress in layers.

Let me know if you have any questions or if we need to adjust the timing. Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
