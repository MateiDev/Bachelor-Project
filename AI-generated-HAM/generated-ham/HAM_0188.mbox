Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing to see if you’d be available for lunch next week to catch up on the Henderson project. We could meet at our usual spot on 5th Avenue, say Tuesday or Wednesday around 12:30 PM? Let me know which day works best for you.

Also, the client presentation is scheduled for August 2. I’ll send over the draft slides by Friday, so you’ll have time to review them before our meeting.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
Alice
