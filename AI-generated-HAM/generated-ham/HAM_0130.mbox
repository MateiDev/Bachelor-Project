Hello Jane,

Just a quick reminder that our monthly book club meeting is coming up this Friday, July 19th at 7:00 PM at my place. We'll be discussing "The Night Circus" by Erin Morgenstern. Snacks and drinks will be provided, but feel free to bring something to share if you'd like.

Also, let me know if you need directions. Looking forward to seeing you and hearing your thoughts on the book!

Best,
John
