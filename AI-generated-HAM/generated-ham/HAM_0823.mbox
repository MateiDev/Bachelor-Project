Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. Are you free for a hiking trip this Saturday on the Blue Ridge Trail? The weather forecast looks great, and it would be nice to get some fresh air.

I’m planning to meet at the trailhead around 8:00 AM. Feel free to bring some snacks and water. If you’d like to carpool, I can pick you up at your place around 7:15 AM. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
