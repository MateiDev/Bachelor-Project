Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. As we approach the end of June, I wanted to share the draft agenda for our July team meeting:

1. Project status updates
2. Upcoming milestones and deadlines
3. Resource allocation review
4. Feedback from last sprint
5. Open discussion and Q&A

Please let me know if you have any items to add or if there’s anything you’d like to discuss in more detail. The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, July 2nd at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B. If you can’t attend in person, feel free to join via our usual video call link.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Alice
