Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well. A few of us are planning to try the new café around the corner from the office next Thursday at 1:00 PM. They just opened last week, and I’ve heard good things about their menu—everything from salads to sandwiches and some interesting vegetarian options. Would you like to join us?

Please let me know if that works for your schedule. If not, we can always pick another spot.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,
Alice Johnson
Marketing Team
