Hi Jane,

Thanks for meeting with me yesterday to discuss the upcoming product launch. I wanted to summarize the main points we covered:

- Finalize the marketing materials by next Tuesday.
- Confirm the guest list for the launch event.
- Prepare the budget proposal for the third quarter.

Please let me know if I missed anything or if you have any questions. Iâ€™ll start working on the draft for the budget proposal this afternoon.

Best regards,
John
