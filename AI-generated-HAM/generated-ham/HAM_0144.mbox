Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder that our quarterly team lunch is scheduled for next Friday, January 13th, at 12:30 PM in the office cafeteria. The company will be providing sandwiches, salads, and drinks, but youâ€™re welcome to bring any special dietary items if you prefer.

Please let me know by end of day Wednesday if you have any dietary restrictions or if you cannot attend.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
