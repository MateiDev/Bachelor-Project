Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. It’s been a busy quarter, and I thought it would be nice for us to get together for a casual lunch next week. I’ve looked into a few nearby spots:

1. The Green Garden Café (vegetarian-friendly)
2. Marco’s Trattoria (Italian classics)
3. Riverside Deli (sandwiches and salads)

Please let me know your preference by end of day Monday, July 24th, and I’ll make a reservation for the majority. If you have any dietary restrictions, feel free to mention them as well.

Looking forward to catching up outside of the office!

Best,
Alice
