Hi Bob,

I hope you had a relaxing weekend.

I wanted to touch base about our upcoming project deadlines. We’re on track with the design phase and should be ready to start development by next Monday. Could we meet for lunch this Thursday at 12:30 PM to review the client’s feedback and outline the next steps? I’ve reserved a table at the café in the lobby, but I can change it if you prefer another spot.

Let me know if that time works for you. Looking forward to catching up and finalizing our plan.

Thanks,
Alice Johnson
