Hi Jordan,

I'm really excited about our upcoming hiking trip this weekend! I checked the weather forecast, and it looks like we'll have sunny skies with temperatures around 70°F (21°C). Perfect hiking weather.

Here’s the plan:
1. Meet at the Trailhead Parking Lot at 8:00 AM on Saturday.
2. Bring plenty of water (at least 2 liters), snacks, and a packed lunch.
3. Wear sturdy hiking boots and dress in layers.
4. Trail route: Pine Ridge Loop (approximately 8 miles round trip).
5. Estimated return time by late afternoon.

I’ve also found a detailed trail map online that might be helpful:

Let me know if this schedule works for you or if you have any questions. Looking forward to exploring the park together and catching up along the way!

Best,
Alex
