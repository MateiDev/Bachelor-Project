Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. The weather forecast for this Saturday looks fantastic, and I was thinking it would be the perfect opportunity for our long-delayed hiking trip along the Pine Ridge Trail.

Here’s the tentative plan:
- Meet at the Trailhead Parking Lot at 9:00 AM.
- Bring water, snacks, and sturdy shoes.
- The full loop is about 5 miles, with a scenic overlook at the midpoint for lunch.
- We should be back by late afternoon.

Let me know if that works for you or if you’d like to adjust the schedule. Looking forward to getting some fresh air and catching up!

Cheers,
Alice
