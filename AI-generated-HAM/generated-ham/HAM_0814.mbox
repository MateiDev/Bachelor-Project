Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. The weather this weekend looks perfect for a hike. I was thinking we could head out to Blue Mountain trail on Saturday morning around 9 AM. It should be a moderate route, about 8 miles round-trip, with some great overlooks.

Let me know if that works for you or if you have another trail in mind. I'm happy to handle parking passes and snacks.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
