Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well. I’d like to invite you and the rest of the marketing team to our quarterly team building picnic this Friday at Riverside Park. We’ll meet by the pavilion at 11:30 AM, and lunch will be provided. There will be games like frisbee and board games, so feel free to bring a friend or family member if you’d like.

Please let me know if you can make it and if you have any dietary restrictions. Looking forward to a fun afternoon outdoors!

Best regards,
John Smith
Marketing Coordinator
