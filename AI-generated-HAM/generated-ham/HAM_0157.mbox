Hello Book Club Members,

I hope everyone is doing well and enjoying their winter reading. This is a friendly reminder that our spring book club meeting is scheduled for Sunday, March 5th at 6:00 PM in the Community Room at Maplewood Library (123 Library Lane).

We’ll be discussing “The Great Gatsby” by F. Scott Fitzgerald. If you haven’t finished the book yet, there’s still plenty of time—just bring your thoughts and favorite passages to share. Light refreshments will be provided.

Please RSVP by Monday, February 20th so we can ensure there are enough chairs and snacks for everyone. You can reply to this email or send a quick message in our group chat.

Also, feel free to suggest titles for our summer meeting when you RSVP. We welcome any genre—mystery, historical fiction, non-fiction, you name it.

Looking forward to a great discussion and catching up with you all soon!

Warm regards,
Alice
