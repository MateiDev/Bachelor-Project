Hi Jane,

Looking forward to our picnic this Saturday! Here’s what I have in mind:

- Location: Riverside Park, near the north entrance.
- Time: 11:00 AM
- I’ll bring sandwiches, fruits, and chilled lemonade.
- Could you bring some snacks or desserts? Maybe your famous brownies?
- Also, I’ll bring a frisbee and a deck of cards for some fun.

Let me know if you’d like to add anything else or if the time or location needs adjusting.

Cheers,
John
