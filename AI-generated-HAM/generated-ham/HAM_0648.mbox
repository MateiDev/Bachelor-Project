Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share the results of our recent team outing survey:

1. Preferred Activities
   - Hiking: 45%
   - Picnic in the park: 30%
   - Bowling: 15%
   - Escape room: 10%

2. Date Preferences
   - Week of July 15–19: 40%
   - Week of July 22–26: 35%
   - Early August: 25%

3. Dietary Restrictions
   - No peanuts: 5%
   - Gluten-free: 10%
   - Vegetarian: 15%
   - No restrictions: 70%

Based on these results, it looks like a mid-July picnic is the top choice. I'll check with Facilities for a reserved spot at Riverside Park on July 17th and send a calendar invite once confirmed.

Let me know if you have any questions or additional suggestions.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
