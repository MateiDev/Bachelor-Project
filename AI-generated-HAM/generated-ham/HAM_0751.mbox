Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I was thinking about going for a hike this Saturday at Pine Ridge Trail. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with mild temperatures.

Here’s a proposed plan:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot at 9:00 AM.
- Bring water, snacks, and sturdy shoes.
- The full loop is about 6 miles and should take around 3 hours.
- After the hike, we can grab lunch at the Lakeside Café nearby.

Let me know if this works for you or if you have any other suggestions. Looking forward to catching up outdoors!

Best,
Alice
