Hello Team,

This is a friendly reminder about our upcoming team-building activity scheduled for next Wednesday, June 26th, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM at Riverside Park Pavilion B.

Agenda:
- 2:00 PM – Welcome and ice-breaker games
- 2:30 PM – Group challenge: Scavenger hunt around the park
- 3:30 PM – Snacks and refreshments (we'll provide coffee, tea, and light bites)
- 4:00 PM – Collaborative team puzzle
- 4:45 PM – Wrap-up and feedback

Please RSVP by this Friday, June 21st, so we can finalize our snack order and divide teams. If you have any dietary restrictions or accessibility needs, let me know in your RSVP.

Feel free to wear comfortable clothing and bring any items you think might be useful—sunscreen, hats, or a water bottle. In case of rain, we have reserved the community center nearby as a backup location.

Looking forward to spending a fun and productive afternoon together!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
Project Coordinator
