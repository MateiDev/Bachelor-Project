Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! As we discussed in last week's meeting, it's time to plan our quarterly team outing. I gathered a few ideas from the group and wanted to share them for your feedback:

1. Escape Room Adventure: A fun indoor challenge that encourages teamwork and problem-solving.
2. Outdoor Picnic at Lakeside Park: Bring potluck dishes, play frisbee, and enjoy some fresh air.
3. Cooking Class Workshop: Learn to prepare a new cuisine togetherâ€”good for building collaboration skills.
4. Virtual Game Night: For those who prefer remote-friendly activities, with trivia and board games online.

Could you let me know which option you prefer by Wednesday? If you have other suggestions, feel free to add them. Once we finalize the activity, I'll reserve the spot and send a calendar invite to everyone.

Thanks, and looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Best regards,
Alice
