Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder that our monthly book club meeting is coming up next Thursday, July 18th, at 7:00 PM. We'll be discussing "The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig. Please let me know if you have any trouble accessing the meeting location or need a ride.

Feel free to bring any snacks or drinks you'd like to share. Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best,
Alice Johnson
