Hey Bob,

Great hiking trip on Saturday! I’ve taken a few of my favorite photos from the trailhead and the river crossing. The sun was shining perfectly, and the wildflowers were in full bloom.

Let me know which ones you like best, and I can send you the full-res versions.

Looking forward to our next adventure. Maybe we can try the new trail near Maple Falls next month?

Cheers,
Alice
