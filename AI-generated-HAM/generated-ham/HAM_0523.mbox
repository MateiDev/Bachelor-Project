Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great weekend! I wanted to touch base about our upcoming project deadline and see if you’re available for a quick lunch meeting this week.

I’ve updated the draft document with the feedback from last Friday’s call and attached it here for your review. Could you take a look when you have a moment? I’d love to discuss any additional edits or ideas you might have over lunch. 

I’m free Wednesday and Thursday between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM—let me know which day works best for you.

Thanks, and talk soon!

Best,
Alice
