Hello Team,

Just a friendly reminder that our monthly team lunch is scheduled for this Friday at 12:30 PM at The Garden Bistro.

Please let me know by Wednesday if you have any dietary restrictions or if youâ€™d like to bring a guest.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

Best regards,
Alex Johnson
Team Coordinator
