Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to follow up about our hiking plans for this weekend. The weather forecast for Sunday looks perfect—sunny with mild temperatures. I’m thinking of meeting at the trailhead at 8:00 AM so we can make the most of the morning cool.

Here’s a quick checklist of what to bring:
- Comfortable hiking shoes
- Refillable water bottle (at least 2 liters)
- Light snacks (trail mix, granola bars, fruit)
- Sunscreen and a hat
- A small first-aid kit (if you have one)

The trail is about 6 miles round trip, with a scenic overlook at the halfway point. We can stop there for a break and some photos. I’ll pack a couple of sandwiches and extra water just in case.

Let me know if you need a ride or if you’d prefer to meet me at the parking lot. Also, if there’s anything else you’d like to bring or any adjustments you’d suggest, feel free to let me know.

Looking forward to a great hike!

Cheers,
John
