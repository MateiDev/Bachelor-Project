Hey Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! Are you still up for the hiking trip this Saturday? The weather forecast looks perfect – sunny with a light breeze. I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM. I’ll bring sandwiches, granola bars, and a thermos of coffee.

Let me know if that timing works for you or if you’d prefer to start a bit later. Also, if you want to invite Sarah and Mike, feel free to do so. The more the merrier!

Looking forward to some fresh air and great company.

Cheers,
Alice
