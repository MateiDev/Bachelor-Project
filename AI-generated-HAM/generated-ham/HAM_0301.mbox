Hi Lily,

I hope you’re doing well! I was thinking about our conversation last week and wanted to check if you’re still interested in getting together this weekend.
The weather forecast looks great—sunny with mild temperatures—so it would be perfect for a hike or picnic.

Here are a couple of options:
1. Silver Lake Trail – moderate difficulty, about a 5-mile loop.
2. Maplewood Park – easy stroll, with a nice picnic area by the lake.

Let me know which one you prefer or if you have any other ideas. I’m free on Saturday morning or Sunday afternoon.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Simon
