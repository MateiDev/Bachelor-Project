Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to check in about our plans for this weekend’s hiking trip. The weather forecast looks great for Saturday, with clear skies and mild temperatures. I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead by 9:00 AM. That should give us plenty of time to cover the East Ridge Loop and grab lunch at the summit before heading back.

I’ve packed snacks, water, and a first-aid kit. Feel free to bring anything else you think we might need—maybe extra layers in case it gets chilly. Let me know if that schedule works for you or if you’d prefer a different start time.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some fresh air!

Best,
Alice
