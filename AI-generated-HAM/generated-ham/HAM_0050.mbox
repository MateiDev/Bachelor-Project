Hi Jane,

This is a friendly reminder about our weekly team meeting scheduled for this Wednesday, July 3rd at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. The agenda will include:

 - Project status updates  
 - Upcoming deadlines  
 - Resource planning  
 - Any other business

Please review the project notes I shared last Friday and be prepared to discuss your section. If you have any items youâ€™d like to add to the agenda, let me know by end of day tomorrow.

Looking forward to seeing everyone then.

Best regards,
John
