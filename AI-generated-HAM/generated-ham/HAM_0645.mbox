Hi Team,

I hope you're all doing well. As discussed in our last meeting, let's plan for a team lunch on Wednesday, August 2nd, at 12:30 PM. I found a great spot downtown called The Green Caf√© that offers vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Please let me know by next Friday if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences so I can make the reservation accordingly. Looking forward to catching up outside of the office!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
