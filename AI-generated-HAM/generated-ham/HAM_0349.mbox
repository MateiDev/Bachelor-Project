Hi Bob,

Just a quick reminder that our team hike is scheduled for this Saturday morning. 
We’ll meet at the park entrance at 8:00 AM, and I’ve attached a map of the trail 
we’ll be following. The weather forecast looks clear and cool, so dress in layers 
and wear comfortable hiking boots. Don’t forget to bring water, snacks, and a 
light jacket.

If you need a ride or have any dietary restrictions for the snack packs, please 
let me know by Thursday evening. Looking forward to a great time outdoors with 
everyone!

Best,
Alice Johnson
