Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with light breezes. I’ve mapped out a 5-mile loop on the Pine Ridge Trail that should take around three hours, including breaks.

Meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:30 AM on Saturday. Don’t forget to bring water, snacks, and sturdy hiking boots. I’ll pack some sandwiches and fruit for the group. Feel free to invite anyone you like.

Let me know if you have any questions or need a ride to the trailhead. Looking forward to spending the morning outdoors!

Best,
Alice
