Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! I just picked up a new bookshelf kit and was wondering if you might have some time this weekend to help me assemble it. It's a pretty straightforward assembly, but an extra set of hands would be fantastic. We can grab lunch at that new café downtown afterwards – my treat!

Let me know what works for you. Looking forward to catching up.

Best,
Alice Johnson
