Hi Alice,

I hope you're doing well. Below is the preliminary agenda for our team meeting scheduled next Monday:

1. Project X status update
2. Review of Q1 deliverables and deadlines
3. Allocation of tasks for the new marketing campaign
4. Open discussion and Q&A

Please let me know if you'd like to add any topics or if you have any suggestions. Iâ€™ll circulate the final agenda by end of day tomorrow.

Thanks,
Bob Johnson
