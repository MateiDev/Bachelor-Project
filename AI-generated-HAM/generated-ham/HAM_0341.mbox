Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I've attached the first draft of our Q2 project report for your review. Please take a look and share any feedback or suggestions by Friday afternoon.

Key sections to focus on:
- Executive Summary
- Budget Analysis
- Timeline Adjustments

Let me know if you encounter any issues opening the document.

Thanks,
Alice
