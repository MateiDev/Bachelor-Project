Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. Thanks again for taking the time to meet for lunch today. I enjoyed our conversation about the upcoming project timelines and think we have a solid plan to move forward.

As discussed, I’ve attached the draft schedule spreadsheet for the initial phases, along with a brief outline of the key milestones. Please review it when you get a chance, and let me know if you’d like to adjust any of the dates.

Next week, I’m available on Tuesday or Thursday afternoon for a quick check-in. Let me know which time works best for you, and I’ll send a calendar invite.

Looking forward to collaborating further!

Best regards,
Alice
