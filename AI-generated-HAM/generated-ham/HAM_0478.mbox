Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! The weather forecast for this weekend looks great, so I was thinking we could organize a picnic at Riverside Park on Saturday afternoon. 

Here’s a tentative plan:
- Meet at the park entrance at 1:00 PM.
- I’ll bring sandwiches, fresh fruit, and some lemonade.
- Could you bring a couple of blankets and maybe chips or cookies?
- If you have a portable speaker, feel free to bring it for some music.

Let me know if that works for you or if you’d like to adjust any details. Looking forward to catching up and spending some time outdoors!

Best,
Alice
