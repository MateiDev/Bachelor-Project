Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to finalize our plans for the team lunch this Friday. Here are a few ideas for restaurants nearby:

1. The Green Bistro – they have great vegetarian options.
2. Mario’s Trattoria – classic Italian dishes.
3. Sakura Sushi – fresh sushi rolls and donburi bowls.

Let me know which spot you prefer or if you have another suggestion. Once we decide, I’ll send a calendar invite for 12:30 PM and book a table for the group.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
