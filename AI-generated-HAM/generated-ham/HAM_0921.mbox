Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'd like to schedule a meeting next week to finalize the details for our annual company picnic. We need to confirm the location, catering options, and entertainment. Could you let me know your availability on Monday or Tuesday morning? I'm free anytime between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM.

Also, please send me any dietary restrictions you know of so we can accommodate everyone.

Thanks,
Alice
