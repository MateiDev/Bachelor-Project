Hey Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to touch base about our upcoming project deadline next Friday. I’ve completed the initial draft of the report and added the latest figures from the marketing survey. Could you review the draft by Wednesday so we have time to incorporate any changes before the end-of-week presentation?

Also, would you like to grab lunch on Wednesday around 12:30 PM? There’s a new café that opened near the office that I’ve been wanting to try. Let me know if you’re interested or if another time works better for you.

Thanks, and talk soon!

Best,
Alice Johnson
