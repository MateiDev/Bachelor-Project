Hi Bob,

I'm writing to share the details for our planned weekend hike. Weâ€™ll meet at the Pine Grove trailhead at 9:00 AM on Saturday, July 20th. The trail is about 5 miles with moderate elevation gain, so bring sturdy shoes, water, and snacks.

Here's a quick checklist:
- Hiking boots or trail shoes
- Lightweight backpack
- Water (at least 2 liters)
- Trail snacks (nuts, granola bars)
- Sunscreen and hat
- Light jacket in case it gets breezy

If you have any questions or need to adjust the meeting time, let me know. Looking forward to spending the day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
