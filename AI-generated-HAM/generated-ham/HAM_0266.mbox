Hey Alice,

I hope you're doing well. I'm organizing a casual soccer game this Saturday at Riverside Park, Field 3, starting around 2:00 PM. It's been a while since we all got together on the field, so I thought it would be fun for the group.

Feel free to bring a friend or two. We'll have some snacks and cold drinks, and if the weather's nice, maybe a small picnic afterwards. Let me know if you can make it and if you'd like to bring anything in particular.

Looking forward to playing some soccer and catching up!

Best,
John
