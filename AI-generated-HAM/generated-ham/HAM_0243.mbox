Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. I wanted to share the agenda for our upcoming meeting next Tuesday:

1. Project status updates
2. Review of the design mockups
3. Timeline adjustments
4. Open Q&A

Please let me know if you'd like to add any other topics. If you have any materials to circulate beforehand, feel free to send them over.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
