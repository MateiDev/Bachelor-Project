Hi Bob,

Are we still on for the hiking trip this Saturday? I was thinking we could meet
at the trailhead around 8:00 AM. The weather forecast looks clear, with highs in the
low 70s and no chance of rain. Perfect hiking weather!

Iâ€™ve packed sandwiches, fruit, and plenty of water. Do you want me to bring any
other snacks? Also, let me know if you prefer a different starting time.

Looking forward to hitting the trails!

Cheers,
Alice
