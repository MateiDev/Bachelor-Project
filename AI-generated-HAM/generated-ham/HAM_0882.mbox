Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our plans for the company picnic this coming Saturday. The weather forecast looks promising, and it sounds like a great opportunity to relax and catch up with everyone outside the office.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Location: Riverside Park, Pavilion B
- Time: 11:00 AM setup, lunch at 12:30 PM
- Activities: Frisbee, board games, and a short nature walk
- Food: I’ll bring sandwiches and salads; could you handle some drinks and snacks?

Please let me know if you have any dietary preferences or if there’s anything else you’d like to contribute. Also, if you know a few people who might enjoy leading a quick game or activity, that would be fantastic.

Looking forward to your thoughts. It’ll be a fun day!

Best regards,
Alice
