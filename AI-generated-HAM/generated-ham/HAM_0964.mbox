Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks clear on Saturday morning, so I suggest we meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM. Here's the plan:

- 8:00 AM: Meet at Pine Ridge Trailhead  
- 8:15 AM: Begin the hike  
- 12:30 PM: Picnic lunch at Eagle Point  
- 2:00 PM: Head back down  
- 4:30 PM: Estimated return to the cars

I’ll bring sandwiches, water, and a first aid kit. Feel free to pack any snacks or gear you prefer. If you’d like to invite anyone else, just let me know by Friday evening so I can adjust our supplies.

Looking forward to a great day outdoors! Let me know if you have any questions or need to adjust the schedule.

Best,
Alice Johnson
