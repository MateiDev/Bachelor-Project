Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great week. I wanted to share a quick update on the Apollo project:

1. Design phase is now complete, and all mockups have been approved by the UX team.
2. Development has started and we anticipate finishing the core modules by next Wednesday.
3. I've scheduled a review meeting for Monday at 10:00 AM in the main conference room to go over progress and assign the next set of tasks.

Could you please confirm if this time works for you? Also, let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like us to cover during the meeting.

Thanks for your help and looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
Alice
