Hi team,

I hope you’re all doing well. As discussed in our last meeting, we’re planning
to have our annual summer picnic next Friday, June 14th, at Lakeside Park from
11:00 AM to 3:00 PM.

Agenda:
- Set up tables and chairs (please arrive by 10:30 AM)
- Team lunch
- Games and activities (volleyball, frisbee, board games)
- Clean-up

Food and drinks will be provided. If you have any dietary restrictions or
special requests, please let me know by Tuesday, June 11th so we can accommodate
everyone.

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best regards,
Bob
