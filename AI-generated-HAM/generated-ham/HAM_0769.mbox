Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I’ve been looking at the weather forecast for this weekend and it looks clear on Saturday morning. Here’s what I’m thinking for our hiking trip:

1. Departure time: 8:00 AM from the trailhead parking lot.
2. Trail: Skyline Ridge Trail (approximately 7 miles round trip).
3. Estimated time on the trail: 4–5 hours, including breaks.
4. What to bring:
   - Plenty of water (at least 2 liters each)
   - Snacks and a packed lunch
   - Hiking boots and comfortable clothing
   - Sunscreen and a light hat

If you have any other suggestions or dietary preferences, let me know. We can meet at my place at 7:00 AM and drive up together. I’ll bring a spare first-aid kit and a portable charger for our phones.

Looking forward to a great day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
