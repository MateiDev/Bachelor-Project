Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I’ve updated the project timeline spreadsheet based on our discussion last week.
Please review the milestones and let me know if any adjustments are needed. 
We’re aiming to finalize the first draft by the end of next week.

You can find the document here:

Feel free to add your comments directly in the sheet. 
If you’d like to schedule a quick call to go over any details, I’m available on Wednesday afternoon.

Thanks,
Alice
