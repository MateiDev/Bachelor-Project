Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Here's the plan for our weekend hiking trip:

1. Meeting Time & Place
   - Meet at the Pine Ridge Trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM on Saturday.
   - Address: 123 Forest Road, Greenvale, OR.

2. Route & Itinerary
   - Hike the North Loop (approx. 7 miles round-trip).
   - Lunch break at Eagle Rock around noon.
   - Return via the creek side trail, arriving back by 5:00 PM.

3. Gear & Packing List
   - Comfortable hiking boots
   - Weather-appropriate clothing (light layers, rain jacket)
   - Daypack with water bladder (2–3 liters of water)
   - Snacks (trail mix, energy bars)
   - Packed lunch (sandwiches, fruit)
   - Sunscreen and hat
   - First-aid kit and insect repellent
   - Camera or binoculars (if you want to do some birdwatching)

4. Weather Forecast
   - Sunny with occasional clouds, high of 75°F, low of 55°F.
   - No rain expected, but bring a light jacket just in case.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions for lunch or if you’d like to carpool (I have space for one passenger). Looking forward to a great day on the trail!

Best,
