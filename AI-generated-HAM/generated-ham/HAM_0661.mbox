Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve been looking forward to our hiking trip this weekend and wanted to confirm a few details:

1. Meeting Time: Shall we meet at 8:00 AM on Saturday at the trailhead parking lot?
2. Gear Checklist: Don’t forget to bring water, snacks, a light jacket, and sturdy boots.
3. Route Plan: I’ve mapped our route along the Riverside Trail, which should take about 4–5 hours round-trip.
4. Lunch: I’ll bring sandwiches, but feel free to pack your favorite picnic items.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or if you need a ride. I’m really excited to spend the day outdoors and catch up.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice Johnson
