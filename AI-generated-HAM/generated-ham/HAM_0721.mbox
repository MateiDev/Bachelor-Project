Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to invite you to our neighborhood volunteer cleanup event this coming Saturday.

Details:
- Date: Saturday, June 22, 2024
- Time: 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM
- Meeting point: West Park Pavilion (123 Elm Street)
- Supplies: We’ll provide gloves, trash bags, and bottled water.

This is a great opportunity to spend a couple of hours outdoors, meet neighbors, and help keep our streets and park clean. After the cleanup, we’ll have a light picnic with snacks and refreshments—feel free to bring something to share!

If you can make it, please let me know by Thursday so we can plan accordingly. Feel free to invite anyone else who might be interested.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Alice
