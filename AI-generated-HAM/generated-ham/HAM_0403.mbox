Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! The weather forecast for this weekend looks perfect, so I thought it would be great to get together for a picnic at Riverside Park. We can meet at the pavilion by the river at 11:00 AM on Saturday. I'll bring sandwiches, fruit, and some lemonade.

Feel free to bring anything you'd likeâ€”snacks, games, or a blanket to relax on. Emily and her daughter are planning to join us, and it should be a fun, low-key afternoon.

Let me know if you can make it. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
