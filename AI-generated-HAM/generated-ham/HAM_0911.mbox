Subject: Weekend Hiking Trip Plans

Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The forecast looks clear, with mild temperatures and sunshine expected throughout Saturday and Sunday.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM on Saturday.
- Pack a lunch and plenty of water; there’s a scenic overlook about halfway in.
- We can camp near Pine Lake overnight—remember your sleeping bag and tent.
- On Sunday, we’ll take the ridge loop trail before heading back around mid-afternoon.

Feel free to let me know if you’d prefer any adjustments to the plan. Also, don’t forget to bring sturdy boots and a light jacket for the evening.

Looking forward to enjoying the outdoors and catching up. Let me know if you have any questions or if something comes up.

Best,
Alice
