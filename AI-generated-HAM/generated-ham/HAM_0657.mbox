Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. As discussed in our last meeting, we’re planning our team outing for next Friday, July 5th. Here are the details:

Location: Lakeside Park (Shelter #3)
Time: 11:30 AM to 4:00 PM
Activities: Frisbee, volleyball, board games, and a nature walk.
Food: Potluck style – please bring one dish to share (main, side, or dessert).
RSVP: Let me know by Wednesday, July 3rd, so I can finalize our park reservation and supplies.

We’ll provide beverages, paper plates, and utensils. Feel free to bring any outdoor games or music instruments. If anyone has dietary restrictions, kindly mention them in your RSVP.

Looking forward to a fun day out with everyone!

Best regards,
Alice Smith
