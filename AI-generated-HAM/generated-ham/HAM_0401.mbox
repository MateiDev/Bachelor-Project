Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I was thinking it’s been a while since our last catch-up. Would you be interested in joining me for a pancake brunch this Saturday around 10:00 AM at The Maple Corner Cafe downtown? They have a new blueberry banana pancake special that I think you’d love.

Let me know if that works for you or if you'd prefer a different time. It would be great to catch up and chat about the upcoming hiking trip we mentioned last month.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Alice
