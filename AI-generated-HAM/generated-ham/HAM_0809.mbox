Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about our plans for the hiking trip this Saturday. The forecast looks clear, so I suggest we meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM. I’ve outlined the route and estimated times below:

  - Arrive at the trailhead by 8:00 AM
  - Summit arrival around 12:00 PM
  - Picnic lunch until 1:00 PM
  - Begin return hike by 1:15 PM
  - Back at parking lot by 5:00 PM

Let me know if this schedule works for you or if you’d prefer to start earlier. Also, if you have any dietary restrictions, please let me know so I can plan our picnic accordingly.

Looking forward to a great day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
