Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I’d like to organize a team lunch this Friday, March 15th, to celebrate the successful completion of our latest project. Here are a few restaurant options we can consider:

1. The Bistro Garden – Casual fare with salad and sandwich options  
2. Bella Pasta – Italian restaurant with pasta and pizza dishes  
3. Green Leaf Café – Healthy bowls and vegetarian-friendly choices  

Please reply by Wednesday with your top choice and any dietary restrictions you may have. Once we have everyone’s input, I’ll make the reservation for around 12:30 PM.

Looking forward to spending time together outside the office!

Best regards,
Alice
