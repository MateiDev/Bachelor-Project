Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share the final details for our weekend hiking trip in the Shenandoah Valley.

1. Meeting Point & Time
   - We’ll meet at the trailhead parking lot near Skyline Drive.
   - Please arrive by 8:00 AM on Saturday, July 15.

2. Gear & Supplies
   - Wear sturdy hiking boots and layered clothing.
   - Bring a light backpack with water (at least 2 liters), snacks, sunscreen, and a hat.
   - I’ll pack a small first aid kit and trail map.

3. Route Plan
   - We’ll start on the Hawksbill Loop (approximately 5 miles).
   - After lunch at the summit overlook, we can decide to extend to the Overall Run Falls if everyone’s up for it.

4. Carpooling
   - I can drive two passengers in my SUV. Let me know if you need a seat.
   - Otherwise, park in the designated lot; it’s free on weekends.

5. Weather Forecast
   - Currently, skies are expected to be partly cloudy with lows around 60°F and highs near 80°F.
   - We’ll keep an eye on any sudden changes and adjust as needed.

If you have any dietary restrictions or special requests, just let me know. Looking forward to a great day outdoors!

Best,
John Doe
