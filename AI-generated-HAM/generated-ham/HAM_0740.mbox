Hi Bob,

Just a quick reminder about our team picnic potluck this Saturday at Riverside Park. We’ll meet by the picnic shelter near the lake entrance at 11:00 AM and wrap up around 3:00 PM.

Here’s what everyone has volunteered to bring:
- Sandwiches and wraps (Emily)
- Fresh fruit platter (David)
- Chips and dips (Sara)
- Drinks (water, soda, juice – Michael)
- Plates, cups, and utensils (Jessica)

Could you please bring a dessert of your choice? Something like cookies, brownies, or a fruit tart would be great. Also, if you have a portable speaker, feel free to bring it for some background music.

Let me know if you need any help with transportation or setup. Looking forward to a fun and relaxing afternoon with the team!

Best,
Alice Johnson
