Hello Bob,

Just a reminder that we're hosting a summer barbecue potluck at our place this Saturday, July 23rd, starting at 3:00 PM. Feel free to bring your favorite dish—salad, dessert, or side—and drinks if you like. We'll be grilling burgers, hot dogs, and veggie skewers.

Please let me know what you'd like to bring so we can balance the menu. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying a relaxing afternoon in the backyard.

Thanks, and see you soon!

Best,
Alice
