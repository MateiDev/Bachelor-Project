Hi Team,

Just a friendly reminder that our office potluck is coming up next Friday, July 21st, at noon in the break room. Here’s what’s on the list so far:

- Main dishes: 5  
- Side dishes: 4  
- Desserts: 3  
- Drinks: 6  

If you haven’t signed up yet, please reply to this email with what you’d like to bring so we can balance the menu. Don’t worry if you’re not a chef—store-bought items are absolutely fine!

Looking forward to seeing everyone and enjoying some delicious food together. Feel free to drop by anytime after 11:30 AM to help set up.

Best regards,
Alice
