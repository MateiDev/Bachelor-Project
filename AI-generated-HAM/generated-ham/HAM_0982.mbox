Hello Neighbors,

This is a friendly reminder about our monthly neighborhood potluck dinner happening
this Saturday, June 29th, at 5:30 PM in the Community Garden Pavilion.

Here are a few details and tips:

1. Dish Assignments:
   - If you haven't signed up yet, please reply with the dish category you’d like
     to bring (appetizer, main course, side dish, dessert, or drinks).

2. Tableware:
   - We encourage everyone to bring their own plates and utensils to reduce waste.
   - A few extra sets will be available, just in case.

3. Activities:
   - Children’s story time starts at 6:00 PM under the oak tree.
   - Adults can join a friendly bocce game or lawn trivia.

4. Weather Plan:
   - In case of light rain, we’ll move under the pavilion canopy.
   - If heavy rain is forecast, we’ll update via the community bulletin board by
     4:00 PM on Saturday.

5. Parking and Accessibility:
   - Street parking is available on Maple Avenue.
   - The pavilion area has a wheelchair-accessible path from the main gate.

We look forward to enjoying delicious food and company with you all. Feel free

See you Saturday!

Warm regards,
Alice Johnson
