Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great week. I wanted to share the latest updates on our Q2 project timeline:

1. Design Phase Completion: Scheduled for June 28  
2. Development Kickoff: July 2 – the team is set to begin sprint planning next Tuesday  
3. QA Testing Window: July 15–25  
4. Deployment to Staging: July 30

Could you please confirm your availability for a brief sync meeting next Monday at 10:00 AM? If that slot doesn’t work, let me know your preferred time and I’ll adjust the calendar invite accordingly.

I’ve attached the detailed timeline spreadsheet and a summary document for review. Feel free to send over any comments or questions before our meeting.

Thanks, and have a great weekend!

Best regards,
Alice
