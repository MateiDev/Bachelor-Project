Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share the latest version of our quarterly marketing plan before tomorrow’s team meeting. The key updates include:

  - Revised social media calendar with focus on LinkedIn and Instagram
  - New budget breakdown for paid promotions
  - Updated target audience segments based on recent survey results
  - Draft copy for the upcoming newsletter schedule

Please review the attached document on our shared drive at \\intranet\marketing\Q3_Plan.docx and let me know if you have any feedback. I’ll be presenting these points on Wednesday at 2 PM, so any comments by Tuesday EOD would be very helpful.

Thanks,
Alice
