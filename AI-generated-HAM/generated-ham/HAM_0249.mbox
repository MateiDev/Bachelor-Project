Hi everyone,

I hope you’re all enjoying the start of summer. I’m writing to share some ideas for our upcoming team picnic on Saturday, July 13th at Brookside Park. Please take a moment to review the suggestions below and let me know what you think.

1. Location and Time
   – We’ll meet at the east pavilion near the lake at 11:00 AM.
   – Parking is available along Willow Drive; carpooling might be a good option.

2. Food and Drinks
   – I suggest a potluck format. If you’d like to bring something, here are a few categories:
      • Main dishes (sandwiches, salads, grilled items)
      • Side dishes (fruit salad, pasta salad, chips)
      • Desserts (cookies, brownies, fruit)
      • Non-alcoholic beverages (lemonade, iced tea, water)
   – Please reply with the category you prefer, so we can avoid duplicates.

3. Activities
   – Frisbee and softball (bring your own equipment if you have it).
   – Board games (I’ll bring a couple of classic options).
   – A short nature walk along the lakeshore trail.

4. Other Notes
   – Sunscreen and hats are recommended.
   – Trash bags and disposable utensils will be provided.
   – In case of rain, we’ll move to the Community Center across the street.

Feel free to share any other ideas or preferences. Looking forward to a fun afternoon together!
