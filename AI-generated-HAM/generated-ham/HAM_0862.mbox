Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to confirm our lunch plans for tomorrow. Are we still on for 12:30 PM at The Italian Bistro downtown? Let me know if that works for you, or if you'd like to pick another spot.

Also, I'll bring the documents you requested so we can review them together.

Have a great day!

Best,
Alice
