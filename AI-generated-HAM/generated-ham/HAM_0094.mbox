Hi everyone,

I hope youâ€™re all having a great week! How about we go out for lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM? I was thinking we could try the new Italian place on Main Street. They have good reviews, and it would be a nice way for us to catch up outside the office.

Please let me know by Thursday afternoon if you can make it, or if you have any other restaurant suggestions.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Carol
