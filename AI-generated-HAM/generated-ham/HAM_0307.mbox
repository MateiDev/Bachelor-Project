Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share the draft agenda for our meeting next Tuesday:

1. Project status updates
2. Budget review for Q3
3. Timeline adjustments for the new feature rollout
4. Open discussion / Q&A

Please let me know if you'd like to add any items or modify the order. I'm looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
John Doe
