Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Our team is planning a casual lunch outing next Thursday, October 19th, at The Corner Caf√© downtown. We'd love for you to join us at 12:30 PM. It will be a great opportunity to catch up outside of the office and enjoy some good food.

Please let me know if you can make it, or if you have any dietary restrictions we should keep in mind.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
