Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on our team lunch plans for next week. 
We’re thinking of meeting on Wednesday, February 2nd around 12:30 PM at Garden Bistro 
downtown. It has a nice private room and a varied menu, so it should accommodate 
everyone’s preferences.

Could you let me know if that date and time work for you? Also, if you have any 
dietary restrictions or special requests, just drop me a quick note. I’ll send out 
a formal invite once I confirm everyone’s availability.

On another note, the quarterly report draft is almost complete. I’ll share it with 
you by Monday afternoon so you can review and add comments before our meeting on 
Thursday.

Thanks, and talk soon.

Best regards,
Alice
