Hi Jane,

Just wanted to share the team photo from last Friday's offsite retreat. It turned out greatâ€”everyone's smiling! You can find the photo attached to this email.

Also, a quick reminder that we have our quarterly all-hands meeting next Monday at 10:00 AM in the main conference room. The agenda includes:

- Project updates from each department
- Budget overview for Q2
- Introduction of new team members
- Open Q&A session

Please let me know if you'd like to add any items to the agenda. Looking forward to seeing everyone there.

Best regards,
John
