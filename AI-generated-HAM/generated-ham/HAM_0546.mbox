Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to follow up on our plans for the upcoming weekend. The weather
forecast looks great for Saturday, so I thought we could head out to Pine Ridge Trail around 8:00 AM.
It’s been a while since our last hike, and the wildflowers should be in full bloom this time of year.

Here’s a rough outline of the day:
  - 8:00 AM: Meet at the trailhead parking lot
  - 12:00 PM: Lunch break near the creek
  - 3:00 PM: Summit overlook and photo opportunity
  - 5:00 PM: Return to the car

Feel free to bring whatever snacks and water you need. I’ll pack a small first-aid kit and some extra
sunscreen. If there’s anything else you’d like to add or change, just let me know.

Looking forward to catching up on the trail and enjoying some fresh air!

Best regards,
Alice
