Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our gardening plans for this weekend. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with a light breeze. I thought we could start by laying down mulch around the rose bushes and then move on to planting the new daffodil bulbs I picked up at the nursery last week.

Also, I found that recipe for the lemon-thyme chicken you mentioned. It sounds delicious, and I think it would be great to prepare alongside a chill evening in the garden. Let me know if you want me to bring any ingredients or utensils.

Looking forward to catching up and getting our hands dirty!

Best,
Alice
