Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to give you a quick update on the Mercury Project. As of this morning:

- The design phase is complete.
- Front-end development is at 75%, with the final components expected by Monday.
- Back-end integration tests have passed the initial build.

Next steps:
1. I'll share the updated task list in our team channel by end of day.
2. Please review the UI mockups and let me know if any adjustments are needed.
3. We should schedule a brief sync-up tomorrow at 11:00 AM to go over deployment plans.

Let me know if that time works for you, or suggest another slot. Thanks for staying on top of thisâ€”things are looking good!

Best regards,
Alice
