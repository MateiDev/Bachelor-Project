Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! Are you free for lunch this Thursday around 12:30 PM? I was thinking we could try that new café on Maple Street—I've heard they have great sandwiches and a cozy patio. Let me know if that works for you or if you’d prefer another spot.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
