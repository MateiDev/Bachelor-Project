Hi Bob,

Thanks for attending this morning’s team meeting. Here’s a quick summary of what we discussed:

- Project Milestones: We’re on track for the August 15 feature freeze.
- UI Updates: The design team will deliver mockups by Tuesday.
- Testing Plan: QA will start regression tests next Monday.
- Documentation: I’ll draft the user guide outline by the end of the week.

Please let me know if I missed anything or if you have any questions. I’ve also scheduled our next sync for Wednesday at 10:00 AM.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
