Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Just a reminder that our monthly team lunch is scheduled for next Wednesday at 12:30 PM in the cafeteria. The theme this month is "Summer Favorites," so feel free to bring your favorite seasonal dish or snack.

If you have any dietary restrictions or special requests, please let me know by Tuesday afternoon so I can coordinate with the catering team. Looking forward to catching up with everyone over lunch!

Best regards,
Alice
