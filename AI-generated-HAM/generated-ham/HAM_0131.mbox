Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks perfect with clear skies and mild temperatures.

I’ve planned the route up to Sunset Peak, starting at the trailhead by 8 AM on Saturday. The total distance is around 10 miles round trip, and we should be back by late afternoon.

Please let me know if you have any concerns or if you'd prefer a shorter path. Also, remember to bring plenty of water, snacks, and sun protection.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
