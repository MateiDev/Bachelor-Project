Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well! With the weather looking perfect this weekend, I thought it would be great if we could organize a small picnic at Riverside Park. I checked the forecast, and it’s supposed to be sunny and in the mid-70s on Saturday afternoon.

I’m planning to bring:
  - Homemade sandwiches (turkey, veggie, and egg salad)
  - Fresh fruit platter
  - Lemonade and iced tea
  - A light dessert (brownies or cookies)

Could you bring a blanket or two, and maybe some games like frisbee or cards? If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, let me know and I can adjust what I bring.

Let’s meet around 1:00 PM near the big oak tree by the river. If you need directions or want to carpool, just reply to this email and we’ll figure it out.

Looking forward to a relaxing afternoon together!

Best,
John
