Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! As we discussed in last week's meeting,
we're planning a team picnic on Saturday, October 2nd, at Lakeside Park.
The plan is to meet at the main pavilion around 11:00 AM and
stay until about 4:00 PM.

Here's a quick overview:
- Location: Lakeside Park, Pavilion #3
- Date: Saturday, October 2nd, 2021
- Time: 11:00 AM â€“ 4:00 PM
- What to bring: a dish for the potluck, outdoor games,
  and any personal items (sunscreen, hats, etc.)

Please let me know by Wednesday (September 22nd)
if you can make it and what dish you'd like to bring.
Also, if you have any ideas for activities or dietary restrictions,
feel free to mention them.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon with everyone!

Best regards,
Alice
