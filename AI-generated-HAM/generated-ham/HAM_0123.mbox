Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m writing to confirm the details for our neighborhood potluck picnic this Saturday at Lakeside Park. We’re planning to meet around 11:30 AM near the main pavilion. Feel free to bring any dishes or snacks you like—potatoes, salads, desserts, or even fresh fruit.

I’ll be bringing my famous pasta salad and some lemonade. If you need any serving utensils or plates, let me know; I have some extra supplies we can share. Also, if the weather turns out to be too hot, we can set up a small canopy I’ll bring for shade.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying a fun afternoon with everyone. Let me know if you have any questions or special dietary needs.

See you Saturday!

Best,
Alice Johnson
