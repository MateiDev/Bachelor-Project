Hey Bob,

I'm planning a hiking trip to Blue Mountain next Saturday, August 10th. We'll meet
at the trailhead parking lot around 8:00 AM and aim to reach the summit by noon.
The trail is about 7 miles round trip with moderate difficulty.

Feel free to invite anyone who might be interested. Let me know if you need a ride
or if you plan to meet us there. Also, pack plenty of water, snacks, and wear sturdy shoes.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
