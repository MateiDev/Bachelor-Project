Hi John,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to check in about our plans for the weekend picnic at Lakeside Park. The weather forecast looks promising, so it should be a great day to relax outdoors.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Date: Saturday, August 5th
- Time: 11:00 AM to around 4:00 PM
- Meeting point: Pavilion 3 near the lake
- Food: I’ll bring sandwiches, fruit salad, and lemonade. Could you bring some chips and maybe a dessert?
- Activities: We can play frisbee, take a walk on the trails, or just lounge on the grass.

Let me know if this works for you or if you have any other suggestions. Also, feel free to invite anyone else you think would enjoy a day at the park!

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Jane
