Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. As discussed, our next team meeting is scheduled for
Wednesday, July 17th at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. Here’s the proposed agenda:

1. Project Alpha update
2. Resource allocation for Project Beta
3. Q3 planning and objectives
4. Open floor for questions

Please let me know if you’d like to add any items or adjust the schedule.
Also, if you have any reports or data to share, kindly send them by Tuesday
afternoon so I can circulate the materials ahead of time.

Thanks, and looking forward to a productive meeting.

Best regards,
Alice
