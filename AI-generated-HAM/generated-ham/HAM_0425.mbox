Hi Emma,

I've been thinking about our conversation last week and I'd love to finalize our
plans for the weekend hiking trip. Here are the details I have so far:

1. Meeting Point: Parking lot at Pine Creek Trailhead
2. Date & Time: Saturday, November 11 at 8:00 AM
3. Gear: Warm layers, sturdy hiking boots, backpack with water and snacks
4. Route: Pine Creek loop (approximately 7 miles)
5. Lunch: Picnic at the summit, bring your favorite sandwich

Let me know if these work for you or if you'd like to adjust anything. I'm also
open to carpooling from downtown if that helps.

Looking forward to some fresh air and great views!

Best,
Alex
