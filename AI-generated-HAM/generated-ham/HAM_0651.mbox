Hi Team,

Just a friendly reminder about our office potluck this Friday at 12 PM in the break room. Please bring a dish to share—anything from appetizers and salads to main courses or desserts are welcome. If you have any dietary restrictions or need help coordinating what to bring, let me know.

Looking forward to tasting everyone’s creations and spending a fun lunchtime together!

Thanks,
Alice
