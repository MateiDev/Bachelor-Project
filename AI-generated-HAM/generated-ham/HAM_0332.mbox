Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share the final details for our hiking trip this Saturday.

Meeting Point and Time
----------------------
Let's meet at the Blue Ridge Trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM. There’s plenty of space, so you’ll find us by the big oak tree near the restrooms.

What to Bring
-------------
- Comfortable hiking boots and weatherproof jacket
- At least 2 liters of water (I’ll have a backup reservoir pack)
- Snacks: trail mix, energy bars, and fresh fruit
- Sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat
- A small first-aid kit and any personal medications
- Camera or smartphone for photos

Trail Plan
----------
We’ll start on the East Ridge Path for about 3 miles, then switch to the Valley Loop. Total distance is roughly 7 miles round-trip. The scenery is beautiful, with wildflowers this time of year and a small waterfall about halfway in.

Lunch
-----
I’ll pack sandwiches for both of us. Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences. We can stop at the waterfall clearing to enjoy lunch and take a short break.

Return
------
We should be back to the trailhead by around 3:00 PM. If anyone wants to extend the hike or take extra photos, we can adjust accordingly.

Feel free to reply with any questions or suggestions. Looking forward to spending the day outdoors and catching up!

Best,
Alice

P.S. The weather forecast for Saturday looks sunny with a high of 75°F—perfect for hiking!
