Hi John,

I hope you’re doing well! As we discussed in last week’s meeting, our annual company retreat is coming up in late July. I’ve looked into a few venues and activities that should be fun and engaging for the entire team.

Here’s a rough outline:
- Location: Blue Ridge Lodge, Asheville, NC
- Dates: Friday, July 26 – Sunday, July 28
- Activities:
  1. Team hiking excursion on Saturday morning
  2. On-site strategy workshop Saturday afternoon
  3. BBQ dinner and campfire networking Saturday evening
  4. Optional yoga and mindfulness session Sunday morning

Please let me know if these dates work for you and if you have any dietary restrictions or special requests. Once I have everyone’s preferences, I’ll finalize the reservation and send an updated itinerary.

Looking forward to a great retreat!

Best regards,
Jane
