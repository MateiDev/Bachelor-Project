Hi Bob,

Thanks for attending the project meeting earlier today. Here’s a brief recap of what we covered:

- Reviewed the current milestone status and upcoming deadlines.
- Identified key tasks for the design team to complete by next Wednesday.
- Assigned responsibilities for the client presentation draft.
- Scheduled a follow-up sync on July 28 at 2 PM.

Please let me know if I missed anything or if you have additional comments. I’ll compile the notes and share the updated action items with the group by the end of the day.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
Project Coordinator
