Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder that our community garden workday is scheduled for
next Saturday, March 19th at 9:00 AM. We'll meet by the main entrance of the
garden on Oak Street. Tasks will include planting new perennials, weeding,
and preparing the soil for spring vegetables.

Feel free to bring your own gardening gloves and any tools you prefer,
though we'll have extra rakes, shovels, and trowels for everyone. After
we're done, we'll share homemade cookies and lemonade!

Let me know if you have any questions or if the time doesn't work for you
this week.

Thank you for helping make our neighborhood greener!

Best,
Alice Johnson
