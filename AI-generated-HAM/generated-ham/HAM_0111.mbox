Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to share the draft agenda for our meeting next Wednesday. Please review the items below and let me know if you have any additions or changes:

1. Project timeline updates.
2. Budget review and allocation.
3. Team roles and responsibilities.
4. Client feedback discussion.
5. Next steps and action items.

Also, I suggest we start the meeting at 10:00 AM instead of 9:00 AM to accommodate the new team members joining us in different time zones. Please confirm if this works for you.

Thanks, and looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Alice
