Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on the Orion Project:
- We completed the initial design review last week.
- The development team has started building the core modules.
- QA testing is scheduled to begin on July 1st.

Next steps:
1. Finalize the API specifications by June 25th.
2. Hold a walkthrough session with the frontend team on June 28th.
3. Prepare the demo environment for stakeholder review in early July.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to discuss this in a call. I'm available this afternoon after 2 PM (EST) or tomorrow morning.

Best regards,
Alice
