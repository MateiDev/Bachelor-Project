Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I'm writing to confirm our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks great for Saturday, with sunny skies and mild temperatures. Let's meet at the Pine Ridge trailhead at 8:00 AM to avoid midday heat.

The trail is about 7 miles round trip, rated moderate, and passes by a scenic waterfall. I've pasted the parking instructions below:

- Parking Area A: Coordinates 35.1234, -82.1234  
- Free parking until 6 PM  
- Restrooms available near the trailhead  

Let me know if you need to adjust the schedule or have any dietary restrictions for snacks.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
