scheduled on Thursday, July 25 at 2:00 PM EDT:

1) Project Alpha status updates
2) Milestone deadlines for Q3
3) Resource allocation and responsibilities
4) Open discussion and Q&A

Please review the attached documents before the meeting:

Let me know if there's anything you'd like to add or if you have any questions.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
