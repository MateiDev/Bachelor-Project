Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I'm organizing a spring picnic next Saturday at Riverside Park, and I'd love for you to join. We'll meet at the main pavilion around noon. Feel free to bring your favorite dish or snack to share, as well as any outdoor games you enjoy.

Here's a rough agenda:
- 12:00 PM: Arrival and setup
- 12:30 PM: Lunch
- 1:30 PM: Frisbee and games
- 3:00 PM: Nature walk along the river trail
- 4:30 PM: Dessert and coffee

There’s plenty of parking near the east entrance. If you have any questions or need directions, let me know. I’m really looking forward to catching up and enjoying the fresh air together.

Best regards,
Alice

P.S. If the weather looks iffy, I’ll send an update by Thursday evening.
