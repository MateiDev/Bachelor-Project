Hi Sara,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to check if you'd like to join our hiking trip this weekend.
We're planning to head to Maple Ridge Trail on Saturday morning. We'll meet at the trailhead
parking lot at 8:00 AM. Feel free to bring any snacks or drinks, and don't forget good hiking
boots and plenty of water.

Let me know if you're interested or if you have any questions. We'd love to have you along!

Best,
John
