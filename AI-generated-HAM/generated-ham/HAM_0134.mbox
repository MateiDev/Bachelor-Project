Hi John,

Just a quick reminder about the potluck gathering this Saturday at 5:00 PM at my place. We're planning to start around 5:30, so feel free to arrive a little earlier if you’d like help setting up. There’s no strict menu—feel free to bring your favorite dish, appetizer, or dessert. We’ll have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options covered, so don’t worry if you have dietary restrictions.

Looking forward to catching up and trying everyone’s recipes. Let me know if you need any suggestions or if you’d like to borrow serving dishes. See you on Saturday!

Cheers,
Sarah
