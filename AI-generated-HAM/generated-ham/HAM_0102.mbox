Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I have attached the first draft of our project proposal for the upcoming
client meeting. Could you please take a look and let me know if you have any feedback by end of day
tomorrow? Specifically, I'm looking for your thoughts on the timeline section and budget estimates.

If you want to discuss any changes in person, let's schedule a quick call.

Thanks,
Alice
