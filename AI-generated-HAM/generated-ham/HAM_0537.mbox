Hey Bob,

Just wanted to follow up on our conversation about the weekend hiking trip.
I’ve been looking at the trail maps for Pine Ridge Preserve, and it
looks like we could start at the Ridgeview Trailhead early Saturday
morning. The weather forecast is calling for clear skies and temperatures
in the mid-60s—perfect for hiking.

Here’s a rough itinerary:
1. Meet at Ridgeview Trailhead at 8:00 AM.
2. Hike the Ridgeview Loop (approx. 5 miles) by late morning.
3. Lunch break near Maple Creek around 12:30 PM.
4. Continue on the Fern Glen Overlook trail (another 4 miles).
5. Return to the trailhead by 4:00 PM.

Let me know if that schedule works for you, and if you’d like me to
arrange carpooling. I can pick you up around 7:30 AM on Saturday if that
helps.

Looking forward to a great day on the trails!

Best,
Alice
