Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about organizing a hiking trip this Saturday. Here are the proposed details:

- Meeting point: Pine Trailhead parking lot  
- Time: 8:00 AM  
- Trail: Eagle Rock Loop (approximately 6 miles round trip)  
- Difficulty: Moderate (some steep sections, but manageable)  
- What to bring: water, snacks, layered clothing, sturdy shoes, and sunscreen  

Let me know if that schedule works for you. If you have any suggestions for alternative trails or if you'd like to invite anyone else, feel free to share.

Looking forward to hitting the trails!

Best,  
Alice
