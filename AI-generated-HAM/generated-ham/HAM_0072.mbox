Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. The marketing team thought it would be fun to organize a casual lunch next Thursday, June 27th, at the Downtown Bistro.
I'd like to confirm if you can make it. We'll meet at 12:30 PM in the lobby and walk over together.

Please let me know by end of day Friday if you can join us, and if you have any dietary restrictions.

Looking forward to a relaxing afternoon outside of meetings!

Best regards,
Alice
