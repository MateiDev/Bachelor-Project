Hi Bob,

- Date & Time: Saturday, July 31, 2021 at 8:00 AM
- Duration: Approximately 5 hours, including breaks
- Trail: Lakeside Loop Trail (moderate difficulty)
- What to Bring:
  * Comfortable hiking shoes
  * Water (at least 2 liters)
  * Snacks (trail mix, granola bars)

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to adjust anything. I'm looking forward to catching up and enjoying the great outdoors!

Best,
Alice
