Hi Bob,

I hope you're having a good week. Here’s a quick update on the Evergreen Website Redesign project:

1. Design Phase Complete
   - The new homepage mockups were approved by the UX team on Wednesday.
   - Style guide document finalized and shared in the project folder.

2. Development Progress
   - Front-end team has started implementing the responsive grid layout.
   - Initial code review scheduled for Monday at 2 PM in Zoom (link in calendar invite).

3. Testing Plan
   - QA has drafted test cases for the header and footer components.
   - We plan to begin user acceptance testing (UAT) next Friday.

Meeting Agenda for Monday, August 28:
- Review code review feedback from front-end.
- Confirm QA resources and timeline for UAT.
- Discuss content migration strategy for legacy pages.
- Any blockers or resource constraints.

Please let me know if you’d like to add any items to the agenda. I’ve sent a calendar invite for 2:00 PM on Monday. Looking forward to our discussion and next steps.

Best regards,
Alice
