Hey Bob,

Just wanted to confirm our hiking trip this Saturday. We'll meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with mild temperatures around 75°F.

Here's the plan:
- Pack a lunch and plenty of water.
- Bring comfortable hiking boots and a light jacket.
- Trail length: approximately 6 miles loop.
- Expect to be back around 2 PM.

Let me know if you have any questions or need to adjust the schedule. Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
