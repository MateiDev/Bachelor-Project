Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our weekend gardening session. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with a light breeze on Saturday morning.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Start at 9:00 AM with coffee and pastries in the garden.
- Spend the first hour planting the new herb seedlings.
- Midday break for a light lunch (sandwiches, fruit, and iced tea).
- In the afternoon, we can prune the rose bushes and tidy up the flower beds.
- Wrap up by 3:00 PM and enjoy some fresh lemonade on the patio.

Let me know if this plan works for you or if you’d like to adjust anything. I’ve already picked up the basil, thyme, and rosemary seedlings from the nursery. Feel free to bring any other plants or tools you have in mind.

Looking forward to a productive and fun afternoon outdoors!

Best,
Alice Jordan
