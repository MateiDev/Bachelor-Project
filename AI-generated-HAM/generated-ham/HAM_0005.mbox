Hi Bob,

I’m planning a barbecue this Saturday at my place and would love for you to join. I’m thinking of firing up the grill around 4 PM, and it’ll be a casual get-together with some friends from work. I’ll be grilling chicken, veggies, and making my famous potato salad. Feel free to bring anything you’d like, maybe a side dish or some drinks.

Let me know if you can make it. The backyard is all set up with some foldable chairs and a small table. If the weather’s nice, we can even play some corn hole or frisbee. Hope to see you there!

Best,
Alice
