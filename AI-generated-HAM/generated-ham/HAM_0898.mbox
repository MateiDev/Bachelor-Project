Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. As discussed in our last meeting, let's get together for a casual lunch this Friday at noon. I've made a reservation at Olive Garden on Main Street, but if you have any dietary restrictions or restaurant suggestions, please let me know by Wednesday afternoon so I can make adjustments.

Agenda:
 1. Quick project status updates
 2. Team-building ideas for Q4
 3. Open discussion

Feel free to bring any questions or topics you'd like to cover. Looking forward to seeing you all and enjoying some good food and conversation!

Best regards,
Alice

Hi Alice,

Thanks for setting this up! Friday at 12:00 works for me. I have no dietary restrictions. Looking forward to it.

See you then,
