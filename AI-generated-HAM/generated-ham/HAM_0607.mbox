Hi Bob,

Just checking in to see if you're still up for the hiking trip this weekend. The forecast looks great, sunny with temperatures in the mid-60s. I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM on Saturday. I'll bring snacks and water; let me know if you have any dietary preferences.

Also, I've mapped out a route that covers about 6 miles with some nice lookout points. It should take us around four to five hours including breaks. Don't forget to wear comfortable hiking boots and bring a light jacketâ€”it can get breezy on the ridge.

Looking forward to spending some time outdoors! Feel free to call or text if you want to coordinate details.

Cheers,
Alice
