Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our upcoming hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks great, with sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-60s. I’ve mapped out a 10-mile loop trail that starts at Pine Ridge Trailhead and includes a scenic overlook near the halfway point.

Here’s the tentative plan:
- Saturday morning departure around 8:00 AM
- Meet at my place for coffee and snacks
- Arrive at trailhead by 9:30 AM
- Packed lunch break around noon at the scenic overlook
- Return to the trailhead by 4:00 PM

Let me know if this works for you or if you’d like to adjust the schedule. I’ll bring extra water, sandwiches, and a first aid kit. Feel free to bring any gear you prefer, like trekking poles or a camera.

Looking forward to spending the day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
