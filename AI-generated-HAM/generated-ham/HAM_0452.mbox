Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to remind you about the team building workshop scheduled for next Wednesday, July 17, at 2:00 PM in the main conference room. The HR department has arranged several interactive activities, followed by light refreshments.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if you need to participate remotely. We want to ensure everyone can join comfortably.

Looking forward to a productive session with the team!

Best regards,
Alice
