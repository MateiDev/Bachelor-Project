Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to remind you about the company potluck lunch this Friday, June 28th, at 12:00 PM in the main conference room. We're organizing a signup sheet to make sure we have a good variety of dishes. Can you let me know what you'd like to bring? Vegetarian and dessert options are especially needed.

The sign-up link is available on our internal portal under "Events," or you can reply to this email with your choice.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Alice
