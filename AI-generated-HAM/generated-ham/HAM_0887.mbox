Hi John,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to check if you're free this Saturday for a hike at Pine Ridge Trail. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with mild temperatures—and it should be a great way to get some fresh air and catch up.

If you’re up for it, we could meet at the trailhead parking lot around 9:30 AM. Feel free to bring any snacks or water you like, and I’ll handle the granola bars and sandwiches. Let me know if that works for you or if you’d prefer a different time.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
