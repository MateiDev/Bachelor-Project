Hi Alice,

I hope you're doing well. We're planning a team lunch next Wednesday at 12:30 PM at The Green Bean Cafe. Itâ€™s a great spot with vegetarian options and a relaxed atmosphere.

Please let me know by Friday if you can make it, and if you have any dietary preferences or restrictions.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Bob
