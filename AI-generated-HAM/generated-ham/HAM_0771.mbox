Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder that our team picnic is scheduled for
next Friday, June 21st, at Riverside Park. We'll meet at the main
pavilion at 11:00 AM. Feel free to bring your favorite games or
snacks to share.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or need a
ride. Looking forward to a fun afternoon with everyone!

Best,
Alice
