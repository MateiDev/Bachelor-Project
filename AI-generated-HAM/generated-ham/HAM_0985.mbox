Dear Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm excited about our upcoming weekend hiking trip
to Pine Park. Here's the plan:

1. Meet at my place at 8:00 AM on Saturday.
2. Drive together to the trailhead (about a 1-hour drive).
3. Pack a lunch and snacks—I'll bring sandwiches and water.
4. We'll take the North Ridge trail, which is moderate-level and offers
   great views.

Please let me know if you'll need a ride or if you prefer to meet directly
at the trailhead. Also, feel free to suggest any additional gear we should
bring.

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best regards,
Alice
