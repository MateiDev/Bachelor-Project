Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check if you're available for our monthly team lunch next week.
We were planning to meet on Wednesday, August 31st, at 12:30 PM at The Green Garden
downtown. Let me know if that time works for you or if you'd prefer a different day.

Also, if you have any dietary restrictions or restaurant suggestions, feel free to share them.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
