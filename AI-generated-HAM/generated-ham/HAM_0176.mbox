Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our plan for the weekend hiking trip.
The weather forecast looks great, with sunshine and mild temperatures.

Here's a quick checklist for Saturday morning:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM
- Bring plenty of water (at least 2 liters)
- Wear sturdy hiking boots and layered clothing
- Pack some snacks (granola bars, trail mix, fruit)
- Don't forget sunscreen and a hat

I've mapped out a 7-mile loop that passes by the waterfall and offers scenic overlooks. 
We'll probably finish around 3:00 PM, so feel free to bring a camera or binoculars for wildlife spotting.

Let me know if you need a ride or if youâ€™re joining later. Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice Smith
