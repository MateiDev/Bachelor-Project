Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to confirm our plans for the upcoming weekend hike in the Pine Ridge Reserve. Here’s a tentative schedule:

- Saturday morning: Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM.
- Bring enough water (at least 2 liters), snacks, and sturdy hiking shoes.
- We’ll follow the Ridge Loop trail (about 7 miles, moderate difficulty).
- Plan to stop for lunch near the summit around noon.
- Return via the creek-side path, expecting to finish around 4:00 PM.

I’ve checked the weather forecast, and it looks sunny with temperatures in the mid-70s—perfect for hiking. Feel free to bring any extra layers in case it gets breezy at higher elevations.

Let me know if this schedule works for you or if you’d prefer a different route. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors together!

Best,
Alice
