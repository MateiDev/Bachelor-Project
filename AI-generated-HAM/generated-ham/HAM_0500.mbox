Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. With spring around the corner, I thought it would be the perfect time to plan our annual hike. Last year's trip to the Blue Ridge Trail was such a successâ€”clear skies, blooming wildflowers, and great company.

How does Saturday, April 13th sound for a day hike? We could meet at 8:00 AM at the trailhead parking lot. The trail is about 7 miles round-trip and should take 5 to 6 hours, including breaks. I'll bring some trail mix and sandwiches, and you can handle the hot chocolate.

Let me know if that date works for you or if you have any other suggestions. I'm looking forward to hitting the trail together again this year!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
