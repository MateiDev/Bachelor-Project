Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to confirm the details for our weekend hiking trip in the Pine Hills. Here are the plans:

1. Meeting point and time:
   – Trailhead parking lot, Maple Road
   – Saturday at 8:00 AM

2. Gear checklist:
   – Hiking boots
   – Waterproof jacket
   – Reusable water bottle
   – Trail snacks (nuts, fruit, granola bars)
   – Small first aid kit
   – Hat and sunglasses

3. Route:
   – We’ll start on the North Loop, which is about 5 miles.
   – If we’re feeling good, we can extend to the East Ridge trail for another 3 miles.
   – Estimated return time: around 4:00 PM.

Please let me know if you need a ride or have any dietary restrictions for the snacks. Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best,
Alice Johnson
