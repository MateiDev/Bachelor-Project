Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! The weather forecast for this Saturday looks great—sunny with mild temperatures. I’m planning a hiking trip to Pine Ridge Trail. It’s about a 5-mile loop with some nice overlooks, and I thought you might enjoy joining.

Here’s a tentative schedule:
- 8:00 AM: Meet at the north trailhead parking lot
- 8:15 AM: Start hike
- 11:30 AM: Break for lunch at the summit picnic area
- 1:00 PM: Head back down
- 3:00 PM: Return to parking lot

Feel free to bring a packed lunch, plenty of water, and a light jacket in case it gets breezy at higher elevations. Let me know if you can make it, and if you have any other trail suggestions.

Looking forward to some fresh air and good company!

Best,
Alice
