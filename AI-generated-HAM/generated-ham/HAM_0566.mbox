Hi Bob,

Thanks for meeting me for lunch yesterday. I enjoyed our discussion about the upcoming project milestones and the potential roadblocks we might face.

Here are the main points we covered:
- Finalizing the project timeline by next week.
- Assigning tasks to Sarah and the IT team for infrastructure setup.
- Drafting the initial requirements document by August 15.

Please let me know if I've missed anything or if you’d like to add more details. I’ll update the project plan accordingly and share it with the team by Friday.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Alice
