Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with a light breeze—so it should be a perfect day to hit the trails. I’ve attached a map of the route we'll take, and we'll meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:30 AM.

For breakfast, we can stop by the Café Corner on Main Street. They open at 7:00 AM and have a good selection of breakfast sandwiches and coffee. If you'd prefer something else, just let me know and we can adjust our plan. Don’t forget to bring plenty of water, sunscreen, and a hat. The higher sections of the trail get a bit exposed.

After the hike, I thought it might be fun to check out the little farmer’s market near the park entrance—they have fresh produce, baked goods, and sometimes live music. If you’re interested, we could grab a snack there before heading home.

Let me know if that all works for you or if you have any other ideas. Looking forward to catching up and getting some fresh air together!

Best,
John
