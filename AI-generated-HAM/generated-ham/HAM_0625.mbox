Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well and enjoying the early signs of spring. I wanted to touch base about our upcoming planning meeting for the Fairview Community Garden. We're scheduled to meet next Tuesday, March 26th, at 6:30 PM in the community center’s multipurpose room.

Here’s a rough agenda:
 1. Review last year’s planting schedule and harvest yields
 2. Finalize bed assignments and crop rotations
 3. Discuss volunteer recruitment and outreach strategies
 4. Plan for the annual spring workshop and seed swap

Feel free to bring any ideas or resources you'd like to share. If you have suggestions for guest speakers—perhaps a local farmer or horticulture expert—let me know and I can reach out to them in advance.

Hope to see you there! Thanks for all your hard work making our garden project a success.

Best regards,
Alice
