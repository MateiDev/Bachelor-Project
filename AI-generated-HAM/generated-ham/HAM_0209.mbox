Hi John and Team,

Hope everyone’s week is going well. I’ve drafted the agenda for our Monday morning sync:

1. Quick round-robin updates (5 mins per person)
2. Status on Project Falcon deliverables
3. Feedback on the recent design prototypes
4. Roadmap adjustments for Q3
5. Any blockers or questions?

Please review and let me know if you’d like to add any items. I’ll share the final agenda in the shared folder by end of day Friday.

Have a great weekend!

Best,
Jane
