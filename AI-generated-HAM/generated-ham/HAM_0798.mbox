Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our plan to go hiking this weekend. The forecast for Saturday looks sunny with a high of 78°F, so it should be perfect.

Here’s the tentative schedule:
- Meet at my place at 7:30 AM.
- Depart by 8:00 AM for Eagle Creek Trail (about a 1-hour drive).
- Hike for 4–5 hours, with a lunch break around noon.
- Return home by 4:00 PM.

Things to bring:
- Sturdy hiking boots
- Water bottle (at least 2 liters)
- Sunscreen and sunglasses
- A light jacket (in case it gets breezy)
- Snacks (trail mix, fruit, or granola bars)

Let me know if this works for you or if we need to adjust the timing. Also, feel free to invite anyone else who might want to join.

Looking forward to spending the day outdoors!

Best,
Alice Johnson
