Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Just a quick reminder about the company-wide summer picnic next Saturday, June 29th, at Lakeside Park. We'll start around noon, and we'll have games, music, and plenty of food.

It's a potluck, so feel free to bring your favorite dish. Some ideas:
- Grilled chicken or veggie skewers
- Pasta salad
- Fresh fruit platter
- Homemade cookies or brownies

Remember to bring a blanket or lawn chair for seating. The weather forecast looks sunny and warm.

RSVP if you haven't already, so we know how many people to expect. Let me know what dish you're planning to bring, and I'll update the list to avoid duplicates.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
