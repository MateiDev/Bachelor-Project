Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to touch base about our upcoming project deadline next week. The team has made great progress on the initial planning, and we’re on track to start development on Monday.

Also, would you be interested in grabbing lunch on Friday afternoon? Some of us are meeting at the café downstairs around 12:30 PM to discuss ideas informally, and it would be great to have you join.

Let me know if that works for you, or if you’d prefer a different time.

Have a great day!

Best,
Alice
