Hello Bob,

I hope you’re enjoying the start of spring! Here’s the latest update from the Greenwood Gardening Club:

1. April Meeting Recap
   - We discussed composting techniques and shared soil amendment tips.
   - Member spotlight: Laura Davis presented her rose pruning workshop, which received great feedback.

2. Upcoming Events
   - May 15th, 10 AM: Seed Swap at the Community Center. Bring any extra seeds you’d like to share.
   - June 5th, 9 AM: Wildflower Walk at Brookside Park. We’ll meet at the parking lot and stroll along the north trail.

3. Garden Tip of the Month
   With daytime temperatures climbing, remember to water early in the morning to minimize evaporation and help plants recover from the heat.

4. Volunteer Opportunity
   We’re looking for help maintaining the raised beds at the Eastside Community Garden. If you can lend an hour or two each weekend, please let me know.

Feel free to reply if you have any questions or suggestions for future meetups. We’re always happy to hear new ideas!

Happy gardening,
Alice
