Hi Bob,

I hope you had a chance to rest after our hike on Saturday. It was great to explore Eagle Ridge Trail together. The weather was perfect—sunny with a light breeze—and the wildflowers were in full bloom near the summit.

Here’s a quick recap of our route and timings:

  * 8:00 AM: Met at the trailhead  
  * 8:30 AM: Started the ascent  
  * 10:45 AM: Reached the summit, had snacks and photography break  
  * 12:15 PM: Began descent  
  * 2:00 PM: Back at the parking lot

I’ve attached a few photos from the top in my shared folder (nothing fancy, mostly landscapes). If you have any images you’d like to include, let me know and I’ll compile them into a short album for everyone.

Looking ahead, I’m thinking of planning another outing next month—maybe a less strenuous trail so that everyone from the office can join. I’ll circulate some suggestions later this week. Feel free to share any favorites you have in mind.

Thanks again for the company and good conversations. See you at the team meeting on Wednesday.

Best,
Alice
