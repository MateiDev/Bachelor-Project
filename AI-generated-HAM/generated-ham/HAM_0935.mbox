Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder that our neighborhood clean-up event is scheduled for this Saturday, April 30th, starting at 9:00 AM. We’ll meet at the corner of Maple and Pine Street, and supplies (gloves, bags, and safety vests) will be provided.

Please bring a reusable water bottle and wear comfortable shoes. After we’ve finished, we’ll have a small picnic in the community garden—feel free to bring a snack or a baked treat to share.

If you have any questions or need a ride, just let me know. Hope to see you there!

Best,
Alice Johnson
Community Coordinator
