Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to check if you're free this Saturday for a picnic at Riverside Park. The weather forecast looks perfectâ€”sunny with a gentle breeze. I thought we could meet around noon, bring some sandwiches, salads, and maybe a Frisbee to toss around.

Let me know if that works for you and if you'd like me to pick up anything specific. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
