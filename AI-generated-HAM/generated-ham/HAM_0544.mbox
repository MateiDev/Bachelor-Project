Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to follow up on our conversation about organizing a team outing in July.
Here are a few suggestions for activities and dates:

- Outdoor picnic at Lakeside Park on Saturday, July 13
- Bowling and pizza evening on Friday, July 19
- Hiking trip to Pine Ridge Trail on Sunday, July 21

Please let me know which option works best for you, or if you have any other ideas. Once we’ve agreed on a plan, I’ll coordinate the details and send out an official invite to the rest of the team.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,
Alice
