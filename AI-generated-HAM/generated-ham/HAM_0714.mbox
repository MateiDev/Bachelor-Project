Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on our weekly check-in meeting and provide you with an update on the current status of the Oakridge software rollout project.

1. Development: The new feature for the dashboard filter has passed QA testing and is now in staging. We expect to deploy it to production early next week.
2. Documentation: The user guide has been updated to include the latest UI changes. You can find the draft at https://docs.example.com/oakridge/userguide (internal link).
3. Training: I've scheduled a training session for the support team on Wednesday at 2:00 PM. Please let me know if that conflicts with any calendar events on your end.
4. Next Steps: We will monitor the performance metrics over the next few days. If everything looks good, we'll proceed with the full rollout on Friday.

Please review the above points and let me know if you have any questions or concerns. If you'd like to discuss any item in more detail, I'm available for a quick call.

Have a great weekend!

Best regards,
Alice
