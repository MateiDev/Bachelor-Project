Hi Bob,

I hope your week is going well. I wanted to give you a quick update on the Evergreen product launch. We’ve completed the initial draft of the marketing collateral and have scheduled a review meeting for Monday at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B. I’ve attached the PDF version of the brochure draft to this email for your reference.

Next steps:
1. Review the brochure draft and provide feedback by end of day Monday.
2. Confirm the list of social media channels for our campaign.
3. Finalize the budget estimate with the finance team by Wednesday.

I’ve also reached out to Carla in design to prepare banner ads, and she’ll join our Monday meeting to walk us through her concepts. Please let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to cover or if you need any additional data before then.

Thanks, and I look forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
