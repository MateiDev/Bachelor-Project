Hello John,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to remind you that our monthly team picnic is scheduled for next Friday, July 12th, at Riverside Park starting at 11:30 AM. We'll have lunch, games, and plenty of time to catch up outside the office.

If you have any dietary restrictions or game ideas, please let me know by Tuesday so I can make arrangements accordingly.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon with the team!

Best regards,
Jane
