Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. This is a friendly reminder that our annual team picnic is scheduled for this Friday, July 5th, at Lakeside Park. We’ll be meeting by the main pavilion at 11:30 AM, and lunch will be served around noon.

Here’s the tentative schedule:
- 11:30 AM: Arrival and setup  
- 12:00 PM: Lunch buffet opens  
- 1:00 PM: Team games (volleyball, frisbee, board games)  
- 3:00 PM: Dessert and coffee  
- 4:00 PM: Wrap-up  

Feel free to bring any outdoor games or refreshments you’d like to share. If you have any dietary restrictions or special requests, just let me know by Thursday afternoon so I can coordinate with the caterer.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon with the whole team! Please reach out if you need a ride or have any other questions.

Best regards,
Alice
