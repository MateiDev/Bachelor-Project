Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to check if you're free this coming Saturday for a hiking trip up Maple Ridge. The weather forecast looks clear, and the trails should be in good shape after yesterday’s light snowfall.

We can meet at the trailhead parking lot around 9:00 AM. I’ll bring sandwiches, fruit, and some hot chocolate in a thermos. Feel free to pack anything else you’d like—extra snacks or a camera if you want to capture some of the scenic views.

Let me know if that works for you. Looking forward to spending some time outdoors and catching up!

Best,
Alice
