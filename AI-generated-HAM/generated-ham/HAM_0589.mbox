Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! As you know, our quarterly team lunch is coming up next Friday, October 6th. I wanted to discuss venue options and get your thoughts on the menu.

So far, the suggestions are:
- The Green Garden for vegetarian-friendly options
- Luigiâ€™s Trattoria for Italian cuisine
- The Backyard Grill for a casual BBQ setting

Let me know which you prefer, or if you have any other ideas. Also, if you could send me your dietary restrictions by end of day tomorrow, that would be great.

Thanks, and looking forward to your input!

Best,
Alice Johnson
