Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great weekend. Here’s the update on the Meridian rollout:

1. Design Phase
   - All UI mockups have been approved by the client.
   - Front-end team will begin integrating the designs tomorrow.

2. Development
   - API endpoints for user authentication and data retrieval are 80% complete.
   - We plan to finish development of the reporting module by Thursday.

3. Testing
   - QA has started smoke tests on the staging server.
   - Initial bug reports have been logged in Jira; severity levels assigned.

4. Next Steps
   - Schedule a meeting with the analytics team to review metrics integration.
   - Prepare deployment checklist for the internal demo next Tuesday.

Please let me know if you’d like to discuss any of the items in detail. I’ll send out a calendar invite for our weekly sync later today.

Thanks,
Alice
