Hi Bob,

This is a friendly reminder that our quarterly team lunch is scheduled for tomorrow at 12:00 PM in the main conference room. The catering menu includes a variety of sandwiches, fresh salads, and vegetarian options. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or special requests by the end of the day.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
