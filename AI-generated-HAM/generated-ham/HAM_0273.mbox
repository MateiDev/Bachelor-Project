Hey Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! Just wanted to touch base about the potluck we’re hosting this Saturday at my place. So far we have:

- Sarah bringing her famous spinach dip
- Mike offering to make garlic bread
- Jenna baking brownies

Could you let me know if you’re up for bringing a salad or maybe a dessert? Also, the event kicks off around 5 PM—feel free to swing by a bit earlier if you’d like to help set up. We’ll have plenty of drinks and non-alcoholic options as well.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some good food together. Let me know what you plan to bring!

Best,
Alice
