Hello team,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m excited to remind everyone that our annual team outing is scheduled for next Friday, August 18th, at Lakeview Park.

We’ll meet at the main entrance at 10:00 AM. The plan is to start with a picnic lunch, followed by a short hike on the Lakeshore Trail. Please bring:
- A packed lunch or snacks to share
- Comfortable shoes for walking
- Sunscreen and water bottle
- Any outdoor games or sports equipment you’d like to use

If you need a ride or have any dietary restrictions, let me know by Wednesday afternoon so I can make the necessary arrangements.

Looking forward to spending a fun day outdoors with everyone! Feel free to reply if you have questions.

Best regards,
Alice
