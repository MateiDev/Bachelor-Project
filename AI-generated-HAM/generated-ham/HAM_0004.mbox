Hi Bob,

Just a quick reminder about our lunch meeting tomorrow at 12:30 PM. I’ve booked us a table at The Green Leaf Café on Elm Street. It’s the new place I mentioned last week—they have great vegetarian options.

I’ve attached the draft agenda below. Feel free to let me know if you’d like to add anything:

1. Project status updates
2. Marketing plan review
3. Budget planning for Q4
4. Open discussion

Looking forward to catching up and hearing your thoughts.

Best,
Alice Johnson
Project Coordinator
