Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well! Just wanted to follow up on our conversation about organizing a picnic this weekend. The weather forecast looks great, and it would be lovely to spend some time outdoors.

Here's a rough plan:
- Date: Saturday, June 15
- Time: 11:00 AM
- Location: Riverside Park, near the big oak tree by the south entrance
- Food: I'll bring sandwiches, chips, and fruit. Can you handle drinks and the dessert?
- What to bring: a blanket, sunscreen, and maybe a frisbee or a deck of cards.

Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to adjust anything. Looking forward to a relaxing day in the park!

Best,
John
