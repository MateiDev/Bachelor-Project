Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to touch base about our lunch meeting next week. How does Wednesday, January 6th at 12:30 PM sound? There’s a new café called The Green Leaf that opened downtown, and I thought it might be a nice spot.

Please let me know if that works for you, or if you'd prefer another day or location. I’m flexible and happy to accommodate your schedule.

Looking forward to catching up.

Best regards,
Alice
