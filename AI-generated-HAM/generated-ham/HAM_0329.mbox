Hello Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to remind you about our team lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM at Bella’s Bistro. It’s also a chance to discuss our upcoming volunteer event at the local community garden next month.

Please let me know if you have any dietary preferences. I’m looking forward to catching up and planning the details together.

Best regards,
Alice
