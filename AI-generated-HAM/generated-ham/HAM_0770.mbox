Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to check if you’re interested in joining a weekend hiking trip this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great and we plan to start at 8 AM from the trailhead near Pine Valley.

Let me know if you’d like to come along. We’ll bring snacks and plenty of water. Feel free to invite anyone else who might be interested.

Best,
Alice
