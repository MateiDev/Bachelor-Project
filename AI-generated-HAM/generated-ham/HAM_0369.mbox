Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I'm writing to confirm our next Weekend Book Club meeting:
Date: Saturday, July 24, 2021
Time: 2:00 PM
Location: Community Center, Room 5

We'll be discussing chapters 4 through 6 of "The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig. Feel free to bring your favorite beverage and any notes or questions you have about the book. After the discussion, we're planning a short walk in the park nearby, weather permitting.

Please let me know if you're able to attend or if you have any suggestions for snacks. Looking forward to seeing you this Saturday!

Best regards,
Alice

P.S. If you need a ride, just give me a call and I can pick you up around 1:30 PM.
