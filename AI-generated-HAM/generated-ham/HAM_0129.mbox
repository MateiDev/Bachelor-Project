Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our weekend hiking trip. I checked the trail conditions, and everything looks good. The weather forecast predicts sunny skies with highs around 75°F, so it should be a perfect day for being outdoors.

Here’s the plan:
- Meet at my place at 8:00 AM on Saturday.
- Carpool to Pine Ridge Trailhead (it’s about a 45-minute drive).
- Pack a lunch and plenty of water; there are picnic areas about halfway through the trail.
- We can aim to finish the hike by 3:00 PM and grab a bite in town afterward.

Let me know if that schedule works for you, or if you need to adjust any details. If you have any trail snacks or equipment you’d like to bring, feel free to do so. I’ll handle the sandwiches and drinks.

Looking forward to a fun day on the trail!

Best,
Alice
