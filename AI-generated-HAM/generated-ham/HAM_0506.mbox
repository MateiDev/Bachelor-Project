Hi Bob,

Just a quick reminder that our team outing is scheduled for this Friday at 3:00 PM.
We'll meet in the lobby and head over together to the Riverside Park. Please
wear comfortable shoes and check the weather forecast â€“ it might rain.

Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or need a ride.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon!

Best,
Alice
