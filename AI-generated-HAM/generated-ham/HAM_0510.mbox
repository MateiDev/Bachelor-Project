Hey Jane,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to check in about our hiking trip this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with mild temperatures around 70°F.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM.
- Bring plenty of water and some snacks (trail mix, fruit, energy bars).
- I’ll handle picking up a small first-aid kit and a map of the area.
- Total hike distance is about 6 miles with moderate elevation gain.

Let me know if that timing works for you or if you’d like to adjust anything. Also, if you have any dietary preferences or snack ideas, feel free to share!

Looking forward to spending the day outdoors.

Best,
John
