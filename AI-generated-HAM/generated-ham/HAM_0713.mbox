Hello Team,

Just a friendly reminder that our weekly team lunch is scheduled for tomorrow, Friday, August 21st, at 12:00 PM in the 5th-floor cafeteria. Please let me know by today at 3:00 PM if you have any dietary restrictions or if you cannot attend.

Agenda for the lunch:
  - Celebrate recent project milestones
  - Share updates on ongoing tasks
  - Gather ideas for next quarter’s team-building event

If you have any suggestions for the event or topics you’d like to discuss at lunch, feel free to reply to this email.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

Best regards,
Alice
