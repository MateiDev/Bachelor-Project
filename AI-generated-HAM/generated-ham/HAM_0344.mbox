Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to remind you about our community garden meetup this Saturday at 10:00 AM. We'll be planting sunflowers and tomatoes in the east plot, followed by a casual potluck lunch under the oak tree.

Could you bring your garden gloves and any seed packets you have left? Also, if you have a tarp or extra gardening tools, that would be really helpful.

Looking forward to seeing everyone and making some progress on the raised beds. Feel free to invite any neighbors who might be interested.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Alice
