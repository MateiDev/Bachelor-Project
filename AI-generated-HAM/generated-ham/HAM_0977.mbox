Hi team,

Let's gather for lunch next Wednesday to celebrate the quarterly milestones. I've booked us a table at The Green Spoon at noon.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences. If possible, respond by end of day Friday so I can confirm the reservation.

Looking forward to seeing everyone and enjoying a nice break together.

Best,
John Doe
