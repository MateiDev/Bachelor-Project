Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! With the weather forecast looking clear this weekend,
I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to go on that hiking trip we talked
about. There's a nice trail at Silverwood Park that's about 7 miles round-trip,
with a scenic lake view halfway.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Departure: Saturday, July 15 at 8:00 AM from my place.
- Trail details: Moderate difficulty, bring sturdy shoes and water.
- Lunch: Picnic at the lake—I'll pack sandwiches and fruit.
- Return: Around 3:00 PM, unless we decide to explore a bit longer.

Let me know if this works for you or if you’d like to adjust any details.
Looking forward to getting some fresh air and catching up!

Best,
Alice
