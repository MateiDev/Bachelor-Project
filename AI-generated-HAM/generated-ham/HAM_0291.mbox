Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to remind you about our team outing scheduled for next Friday, September 22nd. We’ll be meeting at 4:00 PM in the lobby of our office building and then heading to Lakeside Park for a few hours of games, a picnic, and some team-building activities.

Please let me know by Wednesday if you have any dietary restrictions or if you need a ride. We’re planning to bring sandwiches, salads, and snacks, and we’ll have cold drinks on hand. Feel free to bring your favorite board game or sports equipment if you’d like.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon with the whole team! Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Best regards,
Alice
