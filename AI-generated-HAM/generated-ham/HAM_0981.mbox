Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder that our team lunch is scheduled for next Wednesday, July 10th, at 12:30 PM in the cafeteria on the 3rd floor. The department head will join us, and we'll be discussing upcoming project milestones in a casual setting.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if you need to adjust the time. Otherwise, see you there!

Thanks,
Alice Smith
