Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I've drafted a tentative agenda for our team meeting next week. Please review the items below and let me know if you'd like to add or modify anything:

1. Project Alpha status update
2. Review of Q2 sales figures
3. Marketing campaign plan for July
4. Budget allocation for upcoming events
5. Any other business

Let's plan to meet on Tuesday at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B. If this time doesn't work for you, please suggest an alternative slot.

Best regards,
Alice
