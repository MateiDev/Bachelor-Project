Hey Bob,

Let's meet for lunch next Wednesday at the new cafe on 5th Street. I heard they have great sandwiches and salads. How does 12:30 PM sound?

If that doesn't work, I'm also free on Thursday afternoon. Let me know what works best for you, and I'll make the reservation.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
