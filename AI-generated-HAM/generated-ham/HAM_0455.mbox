Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to check in about our hiking trip this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with a light breeze. I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead at 8:00 AM. It's about a two-hour hike round trip, and there's a nice lookout point at the summit where we can stop for lunch.

Let me know if that still works for you or if you’d prefer a different time. Also, if you need a ride, I can swing by and pick you up around 7:30 AM.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Best,
Alice
