Hey Jane,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check in about our plan to grab lunch next week. How does Thursday, July 6th around 12:30 PM work for you? I was thinking we could try that new Italian cafe downtownâ€”I've heard great things about their bruschetta.

Let me know if that date and time fit your schedule or if you'd prefer a different spot. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Test User
