Hi Bob,

Just a reminder that we have our lunch meeting scheduled for this Thursday at 12:30 PM at The Corner Bistro. I'll bring along the draft report we discussed last week, and we can go over it before finalizing.

Let me know if anything comes up or if you need to reschedule.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
