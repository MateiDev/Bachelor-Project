Hi Sarah,

It was great seeing you at brunch last weekend! As promised, hereâ€™s the recipe for the blueberry pancakes we made together.

Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/4 cups milk
- 1 large egg
- 3 tablespoons melted butter
- 1 cup fresh blueberries

Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.
2. In another bowl, beat the egg and then whisk in the milk and melted butter.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.
4. Gently fold in the blueberries.
5. Heat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat and lightly grease it.
6. Scoop 1/4 cup of batter per pancake onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown.
7. Serve warm with maple syrup and extra berries if desired.

Hope you enjoy making these as much as we did! Let me know how they turn out.

Best,
John

P.S. Next time we should try adding a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter.
