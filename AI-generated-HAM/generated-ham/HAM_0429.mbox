Hi Bob,

I hope this message finds you well. The weather forecast looks perfect for this Saturday, so I’m organizing a small picnic at Central Park around noon. I’ll bring sandwiches, fruit, and lemonade. Feel free to bring something to share if you’d like.

Let me know if you can make it. We’ll meet near the Bethesda Fountain and set up blankets there. It should be a relaxing afternoon catching up and enjoying the sunshine.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Alice
