Hi Bob,

Just a quick reminder that we're having a team lunch next Friday, July 5th, at The Garden Bistro.
Weâ€™ll meet in the cafeteria at 12:00 PM and head over together. Please let me know by
this Wednesday if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences.

Looking forward to catching up outside the office!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
