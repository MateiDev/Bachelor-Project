Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. A few of us from the hiking group are planning a day trip to Blue Mountain this Saturday. We plan to meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM and return by late afternoon. Please let me know if you're interested and whether you need a ride.

Also, the overnight forecast looks goodâ€”mild and sunny. Don't forget to bring plenty of water, snacks, and a light jacket. We'll pack sandwiches, but feel free to bring anything you'd like.

Let me know if you can join, and I'll add you to the group chat.

Best,
Alice
