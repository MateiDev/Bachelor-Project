Hi John,

I hope you’re doing well! I’ve been thinking about organizing a small summer picnic next weekend at Lakeview Park. The weather forecast looks perfect for Saturday afternoon—sunny with a light breeze.

Here’s a rough plan:
- Date & Time: Saturday, July 20, 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM
- Location: Lakeview Park, by the north gazebo
- Activities: Frisbee, board games, and a short nature walk
- What to bring: A blanket, drinks, and any snacks you’d like to share

I’ve already reserved the gazebo, and there’s plenty of parking nearby. Feel free to invite anyone else who might enjoy a relaxed afternoon outdoors. Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or game suggestions.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the summer sun!

Best regards,
Jane Doe
