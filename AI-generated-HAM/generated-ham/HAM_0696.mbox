Hi Bob,

I hope you’re having a great week! The weather forecast for this weekend looks perfect for an outdoor picnic. I was thinking we could meet at Riverside Park at 11:00 AM on Saturday. I’ll bring sandwiches and drinks. Could you please bring a light dessert or some snacks?

Let me know if that works for you or if you have any other ideas.

Looking forward to catching up,
Alice
