Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with mild temperatures—and I've mapped out a route through Pine Ridge Trail that should take us about 5–6 hours round trip.

Here’s the tentative plan:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM on Saturday.
- Bring plenty of water, snacks, and a packed lunch.
- I’ll carry a first-aid kit, extra layers, and a small picnic blanket.
- We’ll pause at Eagle Rock overlook around midday for lunch and photos.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or need a ride. If you’d prefer a different trail or a shorter loop, just say the word. Otherwise, I’ll see you Saturday morning!

Looking forward to it.

Cheers,
Alice Johnson
