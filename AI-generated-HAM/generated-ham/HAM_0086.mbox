Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check in about our team lunch next Wednesday at 12:30 PM. The plan is to meet in the lobby and head over to The Green Bistro. Let me know if that works for you or if you'd prefer a different spot.

Also, I've updated the draft of the Q3 project report. You can review it at the internal site:

Feel free to leave comments or suggest changes by EOD Monday. We're aiming to finalize the document before the leadership meeting on Thursday.

Thanks, and looking forward to catching up over lunch.

Best regards,
Alice
