Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. As summer is in full swing, I thought it would be a great idea for us to plan a team outing. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Picnic at Central Park – We could meet at the Great Lawn, bring some snacks, and maybe play frisbee or badminton.
2. Bowling Night – There’s a new alley downtown with lanes available for group reservations.
3. Volunteer Day – We could spend a morning helping out at the local community garden, followed by lunch nearby.

Please let me know your preferences by next Monday, June 24th, so I can make the necessary arrangements. Feel free to propose any other ideas you might have.

Looking forward to spending some quality time outside of the office!

Best regards,
John
