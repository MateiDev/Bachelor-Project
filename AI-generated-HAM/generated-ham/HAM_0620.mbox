Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to share the agenda for our upcoming monthly team meeting on Tuesday, January 17 at 10:00 AM. Here's what we'll cover:

1. Project updates
2. Timeline review for the Q1 deliverables
3. Resource planning for the new design phase
4. Discussion of feedback from the client
5. Action items and next steps

Please let me know if you'd like to add any topics or if you have questions. I look forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
