Hello Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. Here’s a summary of this week’s progress on the Aurora project:

  - User Interface: Completed initial draft of mockups and shared them with the design team for feedback.
  - Backend API: Finalized endpoints for data retrieval and updated the Swagger documentation.
  - Authentication: Began integrating OAuth2 modules; currently testing the login flow with our staging environment.
  - Testing: Wrote unit tests for the new API functions; code coverage is at 78% so far.

Next steps:
  1. Revise UI mockups based on design team feedback.
  2. Complete integration tests for the authentication module.
  3. Prepare a demo for next Monday's stakeholder meeting.

Let me know if you have any questions or need additional details. Thanks for your continued support!

Best regards,
Alice
