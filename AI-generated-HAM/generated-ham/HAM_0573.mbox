Hello Bob,

Just a friendly reminder that our monthly team meeting is scheduled for
Wednesday, January 6th at 10:00 AM in conference room B. We'll be reviewing
the Q4 performance metrics and outlining our objectives for Q1. Please let
me know if you'd like to add any agenda items.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best regards,
Alice
