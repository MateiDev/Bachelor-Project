Hi Jane,

I hope youâ€™re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on the Brookside project ahead of our team meeting next Tuesday:

1. Design Phase Complete:
   - All wireframes have been reviewed.
   - Final mockups are in the shared drive (Folder: Brookside/Designs/Final).

2. Development Progress:
   - Backend APIs are 75% implemented.
   - Frontend integration started, with two pages fully functional.

3. Testing Plan:
   - Unit tests covering core modules are in progress.
   - QA environment will be ready by Monday; test cases are documented in the wiki.

Please find the detailed status report attached. Let me know if you have any questions or need additional context before the meeting. 

Looking forward to discussing next steps on Tuesday at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B.

Best regards,
John
