Hi Bob,

I hope you had a relaxing weekend. I wanted to share a quick recap of our project launch planning session from Friday:

1. Timeline and Milestones
   - Finalize feature list by Wednesday, July 3
   - Begin QA testing on July 8
   - Soft launch scheduled for July 22 with internal stakeholders

2. Responsibilities
   - Emily will handle the marketing materials and social media announcements.
   - Carlos is in charge of the setup for the staging environment.
   - I'll coordinate the final review meeting and draft the post-launch support plan.

3. Risks and Contingencies
   - Potential delay in UI assets—design team will provide an updated estimate by tomorrow.
   - Server provisioning might take longer than expected—IT has been notified and will prioritize.

Next Steps:
- We’ll meet again on Wednesday at 10:00 AM to review progress.
- Please send any outstanding documents or mockups before the meeting.

Let me know if I missed anything or if you have questions. Thanks for your help putting this together!

Best regards,
Alice
