Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about two things:

1) Lunch on Wednesday
   Are you available to meet at La Petite Bistro around 12:30 PM? I've heard good things about their new seasonal menu and thought it would be a nice change of pace. Let me know if that works for you or if you'd prefer another spot.

2) Project Milestone Update
   Our team has successfully completed the first milestone of the Q3 deliverables. The draft report is now in the shared folder:
     \\fileserver\projects\Q3\milestone1\draft_report.docx
   Please review the executive summary section by Friday. I'll be updating the remaining sections over the weekend, and your feedback will help us stay on schedule for the July 31 deadline.

If you have any questions or need additional context, feel free to ping me on Slack or reply to this email. Looking forward to catching up over lunch!

Best regards,
Alice
