Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share the agenda for our team meeting scheduled next Wednesday, October 25th, at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B.

Agenda:
1. Project Alpha status update
2. Review of Q4 objectives
3. Resource allocation for the new marketing campaign
4. Team feedback and action items
5. Any other business

Please let me know if you'd like to add any topics or if there are scheduling conflicts. I'll distribute the final agenda and supporting documents by end of day Tuesday.

Thanks, and looking forward to a productive meeting.

Best regards,
Alice
