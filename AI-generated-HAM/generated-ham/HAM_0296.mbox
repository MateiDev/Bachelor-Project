Hello Team,

I'm excited to remind everyone about our annual summer picnic this Saturday at Riverside Park. We’ll meet at the pavilion at 11:00 AM and the event will run until around 4:00 PM. We have sandwiches, drinks, and games all planned, but feel free to bring a side dish or dessert to share if you’d like.

If you have any lawn games or sports equipment (volleyball nets, Frisbees, etc.), please let me know so we can coordinate. Also, if you need a ride or have any dietary restrictions, just reply to this email and I’ll make sure everything is sorted.

Looking forward to a fun day in the sun with everyone!

Best regards,
Test Sender
