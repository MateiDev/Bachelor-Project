Hello Jane,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to remind you about our team building activity scheduled for
next Friday, August 2nd, at the Riverside Park Pavilion. We'll meet at 10:00 AM for a series
of group challenges and a catered lunch at noon.

Please RSVP by Wednesday if you haven't already, so we can finalize the lunch order.
If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, let me know as soon as possible.

Looking forward to a fun event!

Best regards,
John
