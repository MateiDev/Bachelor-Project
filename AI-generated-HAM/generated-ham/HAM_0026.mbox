Hi John,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m reaching out with the final details for our summer team outing scheduled for next Friday, July 19th.

Location: Riverside Park, 123 Park Lane, Springfield
Time: 10:00 AM meet-up by the pavilion; we’ll wrap up around 4:00 PM
Activities: Picnic lunch, frisbee, team relay races, and a short nature walk
What to bring:
- Comfortable shoes and casual attire
- Sunscreen and a hat
- Any outdoor games you’d like to share

We’ll provide sandwiches, snacks, and refreshments. If you have any dietary restrictions, please let me know by Monday so we can make arrangements.

Looking forward to a fun day with the team! Feel free to reply if you have questions or suggestions.

Best,
Jane
