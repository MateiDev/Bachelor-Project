Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! The team was discussing grabbing lunch together next Wednesday at noon.
There's a new café around the corner that looks promising—The Garden Bistro. They have a variety of
sandwiches, salads, and vegan options. Would you be interested in joining us?

If that date doesn’t work, let me know what your availability is, and we can try to accommodate.

Looking forward to catching up outside the office.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
