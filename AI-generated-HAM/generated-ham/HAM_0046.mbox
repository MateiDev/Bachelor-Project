Hi Bob,

Just wanted to follow up on our conversation about a weekend picnic. The weather
forecast looks great for Saturday afternoon, so I thought we could meet at
Riverfront Park around 11:30 AM. I'll bring sandwiches, fresh fruit, and some
homemade lemonade. Feel free to bring any snacks or drinks you like.

Also, if you'd like, we can bring along a Frisbee or a deck of cards for some
games. Let me know what you think, and if that time works for you. I'm really
looking forward to catching up in the sunshine!

Best,
Alice
