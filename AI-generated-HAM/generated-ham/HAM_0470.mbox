Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m writing to see if you’d like to join me and Karen for a hiking trip this weekend. We’re planning to explore Pine Ridge Trail on Saturday morning. It’s about a 10-mile loop with some moderate climbs but great views from the ridge.

Here’s the rough schedule:
- Meet at my place at 7:00 AM.
- Drive to the trailhead by 7:30 AM.
- Start hike by 8:00 AM.
- Break for lunch around noon.
- Return by 3:00 PM.

Feel free to let me know if you need any gear or have dietary preferences for lunch. We’ll pack sandwiches, fruit, and snacks. Don’t forget sturdy shoes, sunscreen, and plenty of water.

Let me know by Friday evening if you can make it. It should be a fun day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
