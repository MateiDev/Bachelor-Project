Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. As discussed in our last meeting, we'll be having a team lunch this Friday at 1:00 PM at the Downtown Bistro on 5th Avenue. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions.

Also, if you have any topics you'd like to discuss during the lunch, feel free to send me a note and I'll add them to our informal agenda.

Looking forward to catching up with all of you!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
