Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our plans for this weekend. The weather forecast looks great, so I’m thinking we could head up to Pine Ridge Trail on Saturday morning. It’s about a 6-mile loop with some really nice views at the summit.

Would you be up for meeting at my place around 7:30 AM? We can carpool and grab coffee on the way. Don’t forget to bring plenty of water, some snacks, and a light jacket—it can get a bit breezy near the top.

Let me know if that works for you or if you’d prefer a different trail. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Best,
Alice
