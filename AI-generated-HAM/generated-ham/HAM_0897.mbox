Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! As we approach the end of Q2, I wanted to touch base about two items:

1. Team Lunch  
   Let's schedule a team lunch next Friday (June 7th) at noon. We can meet at The Greenhouse Caf√© on Main Street. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences.

2. Project Phoenix Update  
   The latest draft of the Project Phoenix report is now available on our shared drive under /Projects/Phoenix/Reports/Q2_Draft.pdf. The key highlights are:
   - Milestone 1: Completed ahead of schedule.
   - Milestone 2: Testing phase begins on June 10th.
   - Risk Assessment: No major blockers identified.

    Could you review the draft by Wednesday, June 5th? Your feedback on the risk mitigation section would be especially valuable.

Thanks for your attention. Looking forward to our lunch and your insights on the report!

Best regards,
Alice
