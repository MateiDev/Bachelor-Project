Hello Team,

I hope you’re all doing well. As a reminder, we’ve scheduled our monthly team lunch for next Wednesday, June 19th, at 12:30 PM in the main cafeteria on the 5th floor. This is a great opportunity to catch up, share updates, and enjoy a meal together.

Please let me know by Tuesday end of day if you have any dietary restrictions or specific preferences so I can coordinate with the catering service. If you’d rather bring your own lunch and just join us for conversation, that’s perfectly fine—just RSVP so I can get an accurate headcount.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

Best regards,
Alice
