Hey Bob,

I'm planning a hiking trip this weekend to Blackwood Forest. The weather forecast looks great, and I thought you might like to join. We'll meet at the trailhead at 8:00 AM on Saturday. The hike is about 10 miles round trip, with a scenic waterfall at the halfway point. I'll pack sandwiches, water, and some snacks, but feel free to bring anything you'd like.

Let me know if you can make it. It would be great to catch up outside the office.

Cheers,
Alice
