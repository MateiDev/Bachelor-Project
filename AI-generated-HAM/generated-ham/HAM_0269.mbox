Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I’m organizing a small picnic this Saturday at City Park and would love for you to join us. We plan to meet by the lake at 11:00 AM. I’ll bring sandwiches, fresh fruit, and some snacks. Feel free to bring any outdoor games or drinks you like.

Let me know if you can make it. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Smith
