Hi Team,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’m excited to announce that we’ve scheduled a team outing for next Friday, July 26th. We’ll be meeting at Riverside Park at 10:00 AM for a morning of outdoor activities and a catered picnic lunch.

Here’s the plan:
- 10:00 AM: Gather at Riverside Park main entrance
- 10:15 AM – 12:00 PM: Friendly games (volleyball, frisbee, and board games)
- 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM: Picnic lunch (sandwiches, salads, and beverages)
- 1:00 PM – 2:30 PM: Nature walk along the river trail

Please RSVP by Wednesday, July 24th, so we can finalize the catering order. If you have any dietary restrictions or suggestions for additional activities, let me know.

Looking forward to a fun day together!

Best regards,
John Doe
