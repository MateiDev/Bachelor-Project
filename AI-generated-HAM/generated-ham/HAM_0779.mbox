Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to share the agenda for our upcoming team meeting scheduled for Friday, April 12, at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. Please review the items below and let me know if you'd like to add anything:

1. Project status updates
2. Upcoming deadlines
3. Resource allocation
4. Training workshop planning
5. Any new items

Also, please confirm whether you can prepare a brief summary of the marketing campaign progress. Your insights will be helpful for our discussion.

Looking forward to our meeting. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd prefer a virtual call link instead.

Best regards,
Alice
