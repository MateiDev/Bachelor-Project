Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. Here’s the agenda for our monthly team meeting scheduled on Monday:

1. Project updates from each team member
2. Review of last month’s action items
3. New feature proposals
4. Timeline adjustments and resource allocation
5. Open discussion / Q&A

Please let me know if you’d like to add any topics or adjust the order. The meeting will be held in Conference Room B at 10:00 AM and via our usual video link.

Looking forward to your input.

Best regards,
Alice
