Hi Bob,

I’m starting to outline the agenda for our team offsite next month. So far, I’ve drafted sessions on project updates, brainstorming new features, and a group workshop on user experience best practices. Do you have any other topics we should include?

Also, could you confirm if everyone is available on September 10th? Let me know, and I’ll send out the calendar invites.

Thanks!
Alice
