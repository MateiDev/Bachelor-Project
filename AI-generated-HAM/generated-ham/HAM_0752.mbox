Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. It's been a busy few weeks, but I finally have some free time this week.
Would you like to grab lunch or coffee on Thursday or Friday? There's a new café on Main Street
that just opened and I'm curious to try it out. Let me know which day works better for you,
and if lunch or coffee is preferable.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Smith
