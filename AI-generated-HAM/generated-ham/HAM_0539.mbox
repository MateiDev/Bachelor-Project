Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well! As discussed in yesterday’s meeting, I’ve started drafting some ideas for our team outing next month. I wanted to share them with you and get your input before circulating to the rest of the group.

Proposed date: Friday, August 18, 2023
Time: 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM
Location options:
  1. Riverside Park (picnic, volleyball, nature walk)
  2. City Bowling Alley (two games per person, group snacks)
  3. Art Workshop Studio (team painting session, light refreshments)

Draft agenda:
  10:00–10:15  Arrival and welcome
  10:15–11:30  Activity round 1
  11:30–12:30  Lunch break
  12:30–14:00  Activity round 2
  14:00–14:30  Short team debrief
  14:30–16:00  Free time / informal networking

Please let me know which location you prefer and if any agenda items need adjustments. Once we finalize these details, I’ll send out the official invite and RSVP form to the team.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Best regards,
John
