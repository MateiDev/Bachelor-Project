Hello Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. Here’s the weekly update on the website redesign project:

1. Completed the new homepage mockup; ready for review.
2. Finalized the color palette and typography guidelines.
3. Backend integration with the CMS is currently 60% complete.
4. QA testing of the user login flow is scheduled to start on Thursday.

I’ve uploaded the mockup files to our shared drive under /Designs/Homepage_Mockup_v2. Please let me know if you have any feedback or would like to schedule a meeting to go over the designs.

Best regards,
Alice
