Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about grabbing lunch next week. I'm free on Tuesday and Thursday between 12:00 and 2:00 pm. Would either of those times work for you? There's a new caf√© downtown that I've been meaning to try, but I'm also open to your suggestions.

Let me know what works best, and I'll make a reservation.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
