Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check if you're free next Tuesday or Wednesday for lunch. There's a new caf√© downtown that has great reviews, and I thought it might be a nice change of pace.

Let me know which day works best for you, and I'll make a reservation.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
