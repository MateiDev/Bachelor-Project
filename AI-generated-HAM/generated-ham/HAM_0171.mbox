Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well! As discussed in yesterday’s meeting, we’re planning a team outing next Friday, July 26th. Here are the details:

Venue: Lakeside Park, Pavilion #3
Time: 11:00 AM – 4:00 PM
Activities: Picnic lunch, frisbee, canoeing, and board games
What to Bring: Comfortable clothing, sunscreen, and any personal snacks or drinks

Please RSVP by Wednesday, July 24th, so I can confirm the headcount for catering. If you have any dietary restrictions or suggestions for activities, let me know.

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors with everyone!

Best regards,
John
