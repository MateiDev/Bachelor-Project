Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to let you know that we've scheduled a team outing next Friday,
October 22nd at 5:30 PM. We'll be meeting at Riverside Park for a picnic and some outdoor games.
Feel free to bring along your favorite snacks and drinks. If you have any suggestions or special
dietary requirements, please let me know by Tuesday.

Looking forward to spending a fun evening with the team!

Best regards,
Alice
