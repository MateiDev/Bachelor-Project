Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about getting together this weekend. The weather forecast for Saturday looks great—sunny with a high of 75°F—so I thought we could have a picnic at Riverside Park.

Here’s what I’m planning:
- Pack sandwiches, fresh fruit, and some cheese.
- Bring a blanket or folding chairs.
- Maybe toss a frisbee or play badminton if we’re up for it.

Would you be able to join around 12:30 PM? Let me know if you’d like to bring anything specific—drinks, snacks, or a dessert are always welcome. Feel free to invite Jenny or anyone else who’d enjoy the afternoon outdoors.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice

P.S. Don’t forget sunscreen and a hat if it’s as sunny as they say.
