Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m organizing a small lunch gathering next Wednesday at our usual spot, The Green Leaf Café, around 12:30 PM. A few of the team members from Marketing and Design will be there too. It would be great if you could join us and share any updates on the current project.

Please let me know if you’re available, and I’ll make a reservation. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Johnson
