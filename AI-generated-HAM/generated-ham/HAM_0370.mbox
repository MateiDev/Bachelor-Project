Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about our plans for the weekend picnic. The weather forecast looks great for Saturday afternoon, so I suggest we meet at Riverside Park around 1:00 PM.

Here's what we need to bring:
- A blanket or some folding chairs
- Snacks and drinks (feel free to bring your favorite)
- Sunscreen and hats
- Frisbee or a deck of cards for games

Let me know if you have any other ideas or if you'd like me to pick up anything specific from the store. Looking forward to catching up!

Cheers,
Alice
