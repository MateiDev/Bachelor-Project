Hey Sarah,

I hope you're doing well! The weather forecast for this Saturday looks great, and I was thinking of hosting a barbecue in my backyard. Would you be interested in joining us? I'm planning to fire up the grill around 3 PM, and there will be burgers, veggie skewers, salads, and some homemade lemonade.

Feel free to bring any sides or drinks you'd like. Let me know if you're free and if you have any dietary preferences.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Frank
