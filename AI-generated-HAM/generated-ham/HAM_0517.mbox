Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to see if you're interested in joining me and a few friends for a picnic this Saturday at Riverside Park. We're planning to meet around noon near the playground area. Feel free to bring any snacks or games you'd like. The weather forecast looks great, so it should be a lot of fun.

Let me know if you can make it. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
