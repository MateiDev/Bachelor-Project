Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking plans for this coming weekend. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with mild temperatures—so I think it's a great time to head out to Pine Ridge Trail.

Here’s what I suggest:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:30 AM on Saturday.
- Bring water (at least 2 liters per person) and some snacks for the trail.
- Wear sturdy hiking boots and dress in layers.
- I’ll pack a small first-aid kit and a trail map.

The full loop is about 7 miles and should take us 4–5 hours, depending on breaks. If we wrap up early, we can grab lunch at that café in town afterward.

Let me know if that schedule works for you or if you’d prefer to start a bit later. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the fresh air!

Best,
John Smith
