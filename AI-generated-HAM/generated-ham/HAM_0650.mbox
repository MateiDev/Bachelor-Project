Hi Team,

I've updated the Q3 campaign plan with the latest market research insights and budget adjustments. You can find the document in our shared drive under Marketing > Campaigns > Q3 Plan.

Please review the outline and let me know if you'd like to discuss any details in our meeting on Wednesday at 3 PM.

Thanks,
Alice
