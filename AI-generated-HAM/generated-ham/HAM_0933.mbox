Hello Team,

I hope everyone had a great week. Here are the key updates for our project:

1. Feature Development
   - The new reporting module is now complete. John has finished integrating the database queries.
   - Sarah is working on the user interface tweaks and expects to wrap up by Tuesday.

2. QA and Testing
   - QA testing begins on Monday. Please ensure all your code is committed and merged by end of day Friday.
   - Report any bugs or issues in the shared spreadsheet before the testing window opens.

3. Documentation
   - I've updated the project wiki with the latest API endpoints and setup instructions.
   - If you have any questions or need clarifications, leave comments directly on the wiki pages.

4. Next Steps
   - Weâ€™ll have a brief check-in meeting on Wednesday at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B.
   - Prepare any questions or blockers you'd like to discuss.

Thank you all for your hard work. Let me know if you need any assistance or resources.

Best regards,
Alice
