Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to remind you about the upcoming volunteer
day at the Oakwood Community Garden this Saturday, July 22nd. We'll be meeting
at 9:00 AM by the main entrance near the oak tree.

Our tasks for the day include weeding the flower beds, mulching around the
raised planters, and setting up the new compost bins. Gloves, trowels, and
mulch will be provided, but feel free to bring any tools you prefer.

After we finish, the organizers will have a light lunch with sandwiches and
refreshments. It's a great chance to catch up, meet other volunteers, and
enjoy the garden in full bloom. If you haven't registered yet, please sign up
at the community garden website:

Let me know if you can make it or if you have any questions.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best,
Alice
