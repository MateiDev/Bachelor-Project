Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Here are a few quick updates:

1. The marketing plan draft is complete and ready for review.
2. Budget proposals are due by the end of this week.
3. We’ll have our team lunch on Friday at 12:30 PM at Café Verde.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to schedule a brief call before Friday.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
