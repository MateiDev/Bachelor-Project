Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to finalize our plans for this Saturday's picnic in the park. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with mild temperatures. I propose we meet at Central Park near the West entrance around 11:00 AM.

I'll bring sandwiches, fruit, and lemonade. Could you take care of the blankets and utensils? Also, let me know if you’d like me to pick up anything else.

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
