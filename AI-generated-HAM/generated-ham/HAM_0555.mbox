Hello Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I’d like to schedule our team lunch for this Thursday at 12:30 PM in the office cafeteria. Let me know if this time works for you, or if you have any other preferences. Feel free to bring any favorite snack or dessert to share.

Thanks, and looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
