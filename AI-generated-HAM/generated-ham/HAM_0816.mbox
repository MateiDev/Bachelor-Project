Hi John,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to touch base about our upcoming summer picnic this Saturday. The weather forecast looks perfect, and I’ve reserved a spot at Lakeside Park. I’ll bring sandwiches and lemonades—feel free to let me know if you’d like to contribute anything or have dietary preferences.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the sunshine together. Let me know if you need directions or have any questions!

Best regards,
Alice
