Dear Team,

I'm excited to remind you about our Q2 Planning Workshop scheduled for next Wednesday, March 20th, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. During the workshop, we'll:

- Review Q1 performance metrics.
- Discuss strategic goals for Q2.
- Break into small groups to outline specific action plans.
- Set milestones and deadlines for key deliverables.

Please come prepared with:

1. A brief summary of your team's Q1 achievements.
2. Any challenges you encountered and lessons learned.
3. Suggestions for process improvements.

Lunch will be provided, so kindly RSVP by Monday afternoon to help us finalize the catering headcount. Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions.

Looking forward to a productive session and hearing your ideas.

Best regards,
Alice Smith
Project Manager
