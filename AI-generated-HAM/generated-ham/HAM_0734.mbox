Hi everyone,

I'm excited to invite you all to our summer team lunch next Friday, July 12th, at 1:00 PM at The Garden Bistro on Main Street. This will be a great opportunity to catch up outside the office and enjoy some delicious food together.

Please let me know by Wednesday if you can make it, and if you have any dietary restrictions. I'll make arrangements for seating and pre-ordering in advance.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best,
Alice
