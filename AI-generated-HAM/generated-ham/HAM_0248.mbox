Hi Sarah,

I hope you’re doing well! We’re planning a small barbecue at our place this Saturday afternoon and would love for you to join us. We’ll start around 2:00 PM in the backyard, and there will be plenty of grilled veggies, burgers, and homemade lemonade. Feel free to bring anything you’d like—perhaps a side dish or dessert.

Let me know if you can make it. It would be great to catch up and enjoy the sunshine together.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Alice
