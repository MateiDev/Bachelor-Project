Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve attached the draft for our Q2 marketing strategy, including updated budget allocations and campaign timelines. Please review the document when you have a moment, and let me know if you’d like to discuss any of the sections in more detail.

Key highlights:
- Increased social media ad spend by 15% to boost engagement
- Retargeting campaign for product launch in July
- Monthly performance review meetings scheduled for Fridays

Let’s schedule a call early next week to finalize everything. I’m available Monday and Tuesday afternoon; let me know your preference.

Thanks,
John
