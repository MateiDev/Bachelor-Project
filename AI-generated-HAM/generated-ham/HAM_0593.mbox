Hi Bob,

I hope youâ€™re doing well. Are you available for a team lunch next Wednesday, June 19th, around 12:30 PM? I was thinking we could try that new Italian place, Bella Piazza, downtown. Let me know if that works for you or if you have any other suggestions.

Also, feel free to invite anyone else from the team who might be interested.

Thanks,
Alice Johnson
