Hi Bob,

I hope your week is going well. I wanted to touch base about scheduling our team meeting next Tuesday at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. We have a few project updates to review, and it would be great to discuss the upcoming deadlines for the marketing campaign.

After the meeting, I thought it would be nice to grab lunch together. There’s a new café around the corner called The Green Leaf that serves healthy bowls and sandwiches. Let me know if you’re interested or if you have another spot in mind.

Please feel free to invite anyone else from the team who should be there. If the suggested time doesn’t work for you, just let me know and we can adjust.

Thanks, and looking forward to catching up.

Best regards,
Alice
