Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to confirm our plans for the weekend hiking trip. Here are the details:

- Meeting point: Pine Valley Trailhead at 8:00 AM on Saturday.
- Route: Summit Loop, approximately 10 miles round-trip.
- Duration: 5â€“6 hours of hiking.
- Pack essentials: water, snacks, sunscreen, a light jacket, and trekking poles.

If you have any dietary preferences or need carpool arrangements, just let me know. Otherwise, I'll see you on Saturday morning!

Looking forward to a great day on the trail.

Best regards,
Alice
