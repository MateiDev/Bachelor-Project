Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! Are you available for a quick lunch meeting next Wednesday, July 14th? I'd like to discuss the upcoming project timeline and get your input on the resource allocation plan.

Let me know what time works best for you. The caf√© near the office park is usually quiet around noon, but I'm flexible if you'd prefer someplace else.

Looking forward to catching up.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
