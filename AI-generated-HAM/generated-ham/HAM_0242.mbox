Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to check if you’re free this Friday for lunch. A new cafe opened up a few blocks away from the office – it’s called The Green Spoon. I’ve heard they have great sandwiches and salads.

Would you like to meet there around noon? If that works, I’ll send a calendar invite. If not, let me know what time is better for you.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
