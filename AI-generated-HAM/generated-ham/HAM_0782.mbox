Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share the final details for our weekend
hiking trip in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Date: Saturday, July 20, 2024
Meeting Time: 8:00 AM
Meeting Point: Main parking lot at Skyline Drive (Mile 47)

Trail: Stony Man Mountain Loop (approximately 4.5 miles)
Difficulty: Moderate
Estimated Return: 3:00 PM

What to Bring:
- Comfortable hiking shoes
- Water (at least 2 liters per person)
- Snacks or a packed lunch
- Light rain jacket (weather forecast shows a slight chance of afternoon showers)
- Sunscreen and sunglasses

I’ve attached a printable trail map to this email in case cell signal is spotty.
Let me know if you need any help with directions or if you’d like to carpool
from my place. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the scenery!

Best,
Alice
