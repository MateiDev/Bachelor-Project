Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Just a quick reminder about our upcoming team meeting tomorrow at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B. We will discuss the project timeline, upcoming deliverables, and allocate tasks for the next sprint.

Please review the agenda I shared last week and let me know if you'd like to add any items.

Looking forward to your input.

Best regards,
Alice
