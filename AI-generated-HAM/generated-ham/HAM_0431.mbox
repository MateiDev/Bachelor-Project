Hello Team,

This is a friendly reminder about our Friday team lunch scheduled for tomorrow at 12:30 PM in the cafeteria on the third floor. Please RSVP by end of day and let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences so we can make appropriate arrangements.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!
