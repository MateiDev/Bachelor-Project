Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. Just wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks great for Saturday, with sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-70s. I suggest we meet at the trailhead at 9:00 AM. Here's the plan:

- Bring plenty of water and snacks.
- Pack layers, as it may get cooler in the morning.
- Don't forget your hiking boots and sunscreen.
- We can take the Lakeview Loop trail, which is about 6 miles.

Let me know if this works for you or if you'd prefer a different time or trail. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors together!

Best,
Alice
