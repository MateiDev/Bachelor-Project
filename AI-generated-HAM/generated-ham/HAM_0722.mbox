Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this Sunday. The forecast looks perfect—sunny with highs around 75°F. I’ve mapped out a 7-mile loop on the Pine Ridge Trail that includes a scenic overlook and a shaded creek crossing.

Here’s the tentative schedule:

- 8:00 AM: Meet at the trailhead parking lot  
- 8:15 AM: Begin hike  
- 10:30 AM: Break at the overlook (bring snacks and water)  
- 11:00 AM: Continue along the ridge  
- 12:30 PM: Lunch by the creek  
- 1:00 PM: Loop back to the cars  
- 2:30 PM: Estimated finish  

Let me know if that works for you or if you’d prefer a different start time. Also, don’t forget your hiking boots, sunscreen, and a hat. I’ll bring the trail mix and a first aid kit.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Cheers,
Alice Smith
