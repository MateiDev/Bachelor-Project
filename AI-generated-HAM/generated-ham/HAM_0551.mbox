Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I was thinking it would be great to have a picnic next Saturday at Lakeside Park. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with a light breeze. How does 11:00 AM sound?

I can bring sandwiches and lemonade, and you could bring one of your famous salads. If you have a portable speaker, we could bring some music as well. Also, let me know if you’d like to invite anyone else; the more the merrier!

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying a relaxing afternoon outdoors. Let me know what you think.

Best,
Alice Johnson
