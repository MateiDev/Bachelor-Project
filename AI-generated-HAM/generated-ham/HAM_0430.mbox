Hi Jane,

I hope you had a great weekend! I wanted to check in about organizing a team lunch next Wednesday, June 12th. A few people mentioned they'd love to try that new caf√© downtown. Would you be available around 12:30 PM? If that time doesn't work, please let me know your availability and I'll adjust accordingly.

Also, if you have any dietary restrictions or special requests, just give me a heads-up so I can make the reservations.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
John
