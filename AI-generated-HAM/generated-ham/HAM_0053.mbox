Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As we discussed in our last meeting, it's time to start planning our summer team outing.

Here are a few ideas:
- A picnic at Lakeside Park, with a short hike nearby
- A visit to the city botanical garden, followed by lunch at the caf√©
- An afternoon bowling session and pizza in town

Please let me know which option you prefer, or if you have any other suggestions. Once we finalize the plan, I'll send out a calendar invite to the entire team.

Thanks, and looking forward to your input!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
