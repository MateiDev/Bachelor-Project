Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our upcoming weekend hiking trip. The forecast looks perfect for Saturday—sunny with mild temperatures. I’ve reserved a parking spot at the trailhead for 8:00 AM, so if we meet at my place by 7:15 AM, we can carpool and grab coffee on the way.

I’ve planned a loop around Pine Ridge, which is about 7 miles total with moderate elevation gain. There are a couple of scenic overlooks halfway through, so we can stop for lunch and enjoy the view. I’ll bring sandwiches, fresh fruit, and plenty of water, but feel free to pack anything else you’d like.

Let me know if that timing works for you or if you’d prefer to adjust the schedule. Also, don’t forget to bring sturdy hiking boots, sunscreen, and a light jacket—mornings can be chilly in the mountains.

Looking forward to getting out on the trail together!

Best,
Alice
