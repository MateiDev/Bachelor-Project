Hello everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well. As a special treat this summer, we’re organizing a company picnic next Saturday, July 17th, at Central Park (East Meadow, near 102nd Street). We’ll meet at 11:00 AM near the main entrance and enjoy an afternoon of games, food, and good company.

Here’s the plan:
- 11:00 AM: Gather at Central Park main entrance  
- 11:15 AM: Welcome remarks and group photo  
- 11:30 AM – 1:00 PM: Picnic lunch (sandwiches, salads, and refreshments)  
- 1:00 PM – 3:00 PM: Outdoor games (volleyball, frisbee, cornhole)  
- 3:00 PM – 4:00 PM: Desserts and social time  

What to bring:
- A blanket or folding chair  
- Sunscreen and a hat  
- Any special dietary items (we’ll have vegetarian and gluten-free options)  

Please RSVP by Wednesday, July 14th, so we can finalize the catering order. You can reply to this email or sign up on the intranet event page.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon with everyone!
