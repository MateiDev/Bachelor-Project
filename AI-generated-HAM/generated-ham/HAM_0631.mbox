Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to share the photos I took during our picnic last Saturday at Green Haven Park. We had such a great time, and I think the pictures turned out really well.

I’ve attached a ZIP file with all thirty images. Feel free to take a look and let me know which ones you like the most. Maybe we can pick a few to print and frame.

Thanks again for organizing the picnic—it was wonderful to catch up with everyone. Let me know if you’d like me to send over the photos in another format or if you need anything else.

Best,
Alice
