Hi Team,

I hope everyone’s doing well. As discussed in today’s stand-up, I’d like to schedule a team lunch next week. Please let me know which of the following days work best for you:

- Tuesday, July 16
- Wednesday, July 17
- Thursday, July 18

Also feel free to suggest any restaurant ideas. Looking forward to catching up outside of meetings!

Best regards,
