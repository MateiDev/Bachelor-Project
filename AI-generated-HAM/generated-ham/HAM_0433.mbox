Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on the Elmwood project:
- The initial draft of the requirements document is complete.
- Development kickoff is scheduled for next Monday, July 24.
- I've assigned tasks to the team and sent out invites for the standup calls.

Could we set up a meeting this Friday afternoon to review the timelines and address any questions? I'm available between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM. Let me know what works best for you.

Thanks, and have a great day!

Best regards,
Alice
