Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Would you be interested in grabbing coffee this weekend at our usual spot? I'm free Saturday morning, but let me know what works best for you.

Also, I wanted to update you on the book club meeting next week. We decided to read "The Great Gatsby" and meet at the library's conference room on Thursday at 6 PM.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
