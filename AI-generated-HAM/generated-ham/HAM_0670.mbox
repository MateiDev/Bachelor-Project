Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend.
Here's a quick checklist of things we might need:

- Trail map and compass
- Plenty of water (at least 2 liters each)
- Energy bars and snacks
- First aid kit
- Weather-appropriate clothing
- Sunscreen and insect repellent

The forecast looks clear, with temperatures in the mid-70s. We can meet at my place around 8:00 AM on Saturday and carpool out to Pine Ridge Trail. That way we should be on the trail by 9:30 AM.

Let me know if any of those items are a problem or if you have any other suggestions. I'm really looking forward to getting outdoors and catching up!

Best,
Alice Johnson
