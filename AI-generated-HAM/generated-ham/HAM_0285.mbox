Hi John,

This is a friendly reminder that our monthly book club meeting will be held next Wednesday, January 10th, at 7:00 PM at my place. We’ll be discussing "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

Please bring your favorite beverage and any snacks you’d like to share. If you need directions or have any questions, let me know.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Jane Doe
