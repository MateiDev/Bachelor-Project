Hi Jane,

I hope you had a great weekend. I wanted to confirm our plans for the team lunch next Tuesday at 1 PM. Let me know if that time still works for you, and if you have any dietary preferences I should pass along to the restaurant.

Also, I've updated the project proposal document. Please review it before our meeting on Wednesday.

Thanks,
John
