Hi John,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to see if you’re free this Saturday evening for dinner at that new Italian place downtown. A few of us from the office are planning to go around 7 PM, and it would be great if you could join.

Let me know if the time works for you or if you’d prefer another day. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Jane
