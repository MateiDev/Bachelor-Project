Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well! Just wanted to follow up on our conversation about the hiking trip this weekend. The forecast looks perfect—sunny with mild temperatures around 65°F.

Here’s the plan:
- Meet at the Trailhead Parking Lot (Blue Ridge) at 8:00 AM on Saturday.
- Bring sturdy hiking boots, plenty of water, and a packed lunch.
- We’ll take the Ridge Loop trail first, which is about 6 miles, then stop for lunch at the overlook.
- Optionally, we can head over to Pine Falls afterward if everyone still has energy.

Let me know if that schedule works for you or if you’d prefer a different start time. Also, feel free to invite Sam or anyone else who might enjoy the hike.

Looking forward to a great day outdoors!

Best,
John
