Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! It’s been a while since our last outing, and I was thinking it would be great to plan a weekend hiking trip in April. The weather should be heading into spring, and I found a few trails in the Green Valley area that look promising.

Here are a couple of options:
1) Maple Ridge Loop – about 6 miles, moderate elevation gain, scenic overlooks.
2) Pine Creek Trail – roughly 8 miles, follows the creek, plenty of shade.

Let me know which one sounds better to you, or if you have any other suggestions. I’m thinking of going either the weekend of April 8–9 or 15–16. We can sort out accommodations—camping or a nearby cabin—once we finalize the dates.

Looking forward to catching up and hitting the trail!

Best,
Alice Johnson
