Hi Bob,

Hope you're having a great week! Would you like to grab lunch next Wednesday at noon? I thought we could try the new café on Maple Street; they have some great vegetarian options. Let me know if that works for you or if another time suits you better.

Also, I wanted to share that the final report for our Q2 project is in progress. I’ll send you a draft by the end of this week so you can review it before our meeting.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Smith
