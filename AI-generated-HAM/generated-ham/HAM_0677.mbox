Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. It’s been a busy few weeks, and I thought it would be nice for us to take a break together. I’d like to organize a team lunch next Friday, November 19th, at 12:30 PM.

Please reply with your preference among the following options:
  1. Italian Bistro (dine-in)
  2. Sushi Bar (takeout)
  3. Vegetarian Café (dine-in)
  4. Mexican Grill (dine-in)

If you have any dietary restrictions or a different suggestion, let me know. Once we have everyone’s choices, I will make the reservation.

Looking forward to catching up outside the office!

Best regards,
Alice
