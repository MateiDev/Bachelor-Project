Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As we discussed in last week's meeting, it's time to
start planning this year's company picnic. I wanted to outline some
preliminary ideas and see what you think.

Date and Venue
-------------
We are considering Saturday, July 20th, at Green Hill Park. The park has
picnic shelters, a playground, and a hiking trail that should be perfect
for families.

Food and Beverages
------------------
I suggest a potluck-style lunch where teams can bring dishes to share.
I'll coordinate a sign-up sheet to ensure we have a good balance of main
dishes, sides, and desserts. For drinks, we can provide bottled water,
lemonade, and iced tea.

Activities
----------
1. Sack races and tug-of-war
2. Face painting for kids
3. Scavenger hunt along the nature trail

Let me know if you have any other ideas or if you'd like to take the lead
on any particular activity. Also, please confirm if the date works for
you so we can reserve the shelter by next Monday.

Thanks,
Alice
