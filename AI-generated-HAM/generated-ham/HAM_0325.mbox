Hi there,

I hope your week is going well! I wanted to check in and see if you’re free this Sunday afternoon. A few of us are planning a small get-together at my place—just some board games, snacks, and light refreshments. Feel free to bring anything you’d like, but don’t worry if you can’t. The more the merrier!

Let me know if you can make it, and I’ll share the address and timing details. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alex
