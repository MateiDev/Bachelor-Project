Hi Jane,

I hope you’re having a great week! As discussed in yesterday’s meeting, we’re planning a casual team outing this Friday evening. Here are the details:

  * Date: Friday, July 14
  * Time: 6:00 PM meet-up
  * Location: Riverside Park (near the main pavilion)
  * Activities: Picnic, frisbee, and board games (feel free to bring your favorite)

I’ve already arranged for sandwiches and snacks, but let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if you’d like to contribute something. Also, if anyone has extra blankets or folding chairs, please bring them along.

Please reply by tomorrow afternoon so I can finalize the headcount. Looking forward to some time outside of the office and a chance to relax together!

Thanks,
John
