Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! As we discussed in yesterday’s meeting, the team picnic is scheduled for Friday, August 4th at Lakeside Park. Here are the details:

• Time: 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM  
• Location: Lakeside Park, Shelter #3  
• What to bring: A dish to share (salads, sandwiches, or desserts are great), and any outdoor games you’d like to enjoy.

Please RSVP by July 20th so we can confirm the shelter reservation and finalize the catering order. You can reply directly to this email or fill out the quick form here: https://www.example.org/picnic-rsvp.

Let me know if you have any questions. I’m looking forward to a fun afternoon with the team!

Best regards,
Alice
