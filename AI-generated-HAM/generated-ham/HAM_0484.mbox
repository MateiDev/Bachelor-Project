Hello Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to remind you about our team lunch scheduled for next Wednesday, June 12th, at 12:30 PM in the cafeteria on the 3rd floor. It will be a great opportunity to catch up informally before we dive into our project status meeting.

Speaking of which, following lunch we’ll have a brief meeting in Conference Room B. The main topics will include:
- Finalizing the design specs for the new mobile app
- Reviewing the latest test results
- Assigning tasks for the upcoming sprint

Please bring your updated progress report and any questions you might have. If you have dietary restrictions for the lunch, let me know by end of day Monday so I can arrange suitable options.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Alice Smith
