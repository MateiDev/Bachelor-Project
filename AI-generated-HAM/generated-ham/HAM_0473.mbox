Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to give you a quick update on the Aurora Project. We've completed the initial design draft, and the team is currently reviewing it. We're on track to finalize the document by December 1st.

Could we schedule a follow-up meeting next week to discuss the feedback and outline the next steps? I'm available on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. Let me know which time works best for you.

Thanks,
Alice
