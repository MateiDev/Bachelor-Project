Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. As discussed in our last stand-up meeting, we’re planning a casual team outing this Friday, April 14th, after work. The details are as follows:

Venue: Riverside Park (Shelter #3)  
Time: 5:30 PM – 8:30 PM  
Activities:  
- BBQ and potluck (feel free to bring a dish to share)  
- Lawn games (cornhole, frisbee, badminton)  
- Music and relaxation

Please RSVP by Wednesday so we can finalize the food and seating arrangements. You can reply directly to this email or add your name to the shared spreadsheet on our internal drive.

Looking forward to a fun evening together. Let me know if you have any questions or dietary restrictions.

Best regards,
Maria
