Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about going for that hike this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with mild temperatures.

Here’s what I was thinking:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot at 9:00 AM.
- Bring plenty of water, snacks, and sunscreen.
- The loop trail is about 6 miles and should take around 3 to 4 hours.

After the hike, we could stop by Riverside Café for lunch. They have a nice outdoor patio, and I’ve heard their sandwiches are excellent.

Let me know if that works for you or if you’d like to adjust the timing. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors together!

Best,
Alice

P.S. If you need a ride, I can pick you up around 8:30 AM. Just let me know.
