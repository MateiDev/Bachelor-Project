Hello Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m writing to remind you about our upcoming Book Club meeting on Tuesday, July 25th, at 7:00 PM in the community library conference room. This month we’ll be discussing “The Midnight Library” by Matt Haig. I think you’ll find its blend of fantasy and philosophical reflection really engaging.

Feel free to bring your favorite beverage or a snack to share. We’ll have a short open discussion, followed by a quick vote on next month’s reading selection. If you’d like to suggest a title, please reply to this email before Monday.

If you can’t make it in person, you’re welcome to join us via our group video call: https://www.example.org/meetup. Just use the link starting at 7:00 PM, and we’ll make sure you’re included in the discussion.

Looking forward to seeing you then! Let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
Book Club Coordinator
