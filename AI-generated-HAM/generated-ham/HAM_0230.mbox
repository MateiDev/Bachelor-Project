Hi Team,

Just a friendly reminder that our annual team picnic is scheduled for this Friday, January 14th, at Greenwood Park. We’ll meet at the east pavilion at 11:00 AM.

Please remember to:
- Bring your own lunch or a potluck dish to share.
- Bring a blanket or folding chair.
- Wear comfortable clothing and sunscreen.
- RSVP by Thursday if you haven’t already.

We have games planned, including volleyball and board games, and we’ll provide beverages and snacks.

If you have any dietary restrictions or questions, let me know.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

Best,
Alice
