Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about organizing a team lunch next week. Everyone has been working hard on the project deliverables and I thought it would be a good opportunity to relax and catch up outside the office.

Here are a few ideas for dates and venues:
- Tuesday, July 23 at 12:30 PM: The Green Garden Café
- Wednesday, July 24 at 1:00 PM: Bella Italia
- Thursday, July 25 at 12:00 PM: Saffron Spice Bistro

Please let me know your availability and any preferences you might have. If those options don’t work, feel free to suggest an alternative date or place. Once we have a consensus, I'll send out a calendar invite with the final details.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
