Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well. Here’s the agenda for our team meeting this Friday, November 17th, at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B:

1. Project Alpha status update
2. Timeline review for Beta release
3. New hires onboarding schedule
4. Q&A and open discussion

Please let me know if you’d like to add any items or need further details. I’ll also circulate the meeting minutes afterward.

Best regards,
John
