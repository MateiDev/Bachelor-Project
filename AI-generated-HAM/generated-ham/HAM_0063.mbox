Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! The weather forecast for this weekend looks great, so I thought it would be the perfect time to have that picnic we talked about. How does Saturday afternoon at Lakeside Park sound?

I can bring sandwiches, fresh fruit, and some lemonade. Feel free to let me know if you’d like to contribute anything—maybe your famous chocolate brownies? Also, if you have any lawn games, bring those along.

Let me know if the timing works for you. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some sunshine!

Best,
Alice Johnson
