Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. I was thinking it would be great to catch up over lunch next week. Are you free any day between Monday and Thursday? I know a new cafe that opened downtown with excellent sandwiches and salads.

Let me know what works for you and I'll make a reservation. Looking forward to hearing about your latest project and how things have been going.

Best,
Alice
