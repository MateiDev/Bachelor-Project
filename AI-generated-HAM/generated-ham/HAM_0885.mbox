Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to remind you about our team lunch scheduled for this Friday at 12:30 PM. We'll be meeting at the Midtown Bistro (123 Main Street) and youâ€™re welcome to invite anyone else from the team who might be interested.

If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, please let me know by Thursday afternoon so I can inform the restaurant.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best regards,
Alice
