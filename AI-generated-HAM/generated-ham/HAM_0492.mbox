Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to remind you about our team picnic next Saturday, June 15th, at Riverside Park. We'll meet by the main pavilion at 11:00 AM. Feel free to bring your family, some outdoor games, and any special snacks you’d like to share.

Here's a quick rundown of the plan:
- 11:00 AM: Gather at the pavilion
- 11:30 AM: Lunch and potluck meal
- 1:00 PM: Frisbee, soccer, and other games
- 3:00 PM: Short nature walk along the riverside trail
- 4:00 PM: Wrap up and head home

Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if you’d like to help with organizing games. The weather forecast looks sunny and mild, so it should be a great afternoon outdoors.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best,
Alice Johnson
