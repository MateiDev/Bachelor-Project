Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great weekend! I've completed the first draft of the Q3 project plan, including timelines, resource allocation, and key milestones. Please review the outline below:

- Timeline: July 15 to September 30
- Resource allocation: marketing team for the first phase, support from development for integration
- Milestones:
  1. Submit initial review by August 5
  2. Complete user testing by August 20
  3. Finalize documentation by September 15

Let me know if you'd like me to adjust any details or if you have additional feedback. I'll be happy to set up a meeting to discuss further.

Thanks,
Alice
