Hi Bob,

I hope you're having a great week! We're organizing a team lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM to celebrate the end of our current project phase. Would you be interested in joining us?

We’re thinking of going to "The Garden Bistro" on Maple Street, but we’re open to other suggestions if you have a favorite spot. Please let me know by Thursday noon so I can make reservations.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Alice
