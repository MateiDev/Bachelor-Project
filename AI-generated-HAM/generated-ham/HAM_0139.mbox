Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to check if you’re available for a lunch meeting next week to discuss our upcoming project. I’ve been gathering some initial ideas and would love to get your input before we share them with the broader team.

I was thinking we could meet on Wednesday, August 9th at around 12:30 PM at the Café Veranda near the office. The menu there has some great vegan and gluten-free options, so hopefully it suits your preferences. If that time or location doesn’t work, just let me know and I can suggest alternatives.

Please let me know what you think, and I’ll send a calendar invite once we settle on the details. Looking forward to catching up in person!

Best regards,
John Smith
