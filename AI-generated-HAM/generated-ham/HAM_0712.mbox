Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to give you a quick update on the Orion Project. Our development team has completed the initial integration tests ahead of schedule, and the QA group has started their review as of this morning. Everything looks stable so far.

Could we schedule a brief meeting early next week to walk through the test results and outline the tasks for the upcoming sprint? I've uploaded the preliminary test report to our shared project folder. Please let me know your availability on Monday or Tuesday.

Thanks again for your help coordinating with all the stakeholders. I'll prepare an agenda and send it over once we confirm a time.

Best regards,
Alice
