Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to remind you about our team lunch scheduled for next Wednesday, July 28th, at 12:30 PM. We'll be meeting at the new café on Main Street—it's right across from the office.

The plan is to order family-style dishes so we can all try a bit of everything. If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences (vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.), please let me know by end of day Monday so I can finalize the menu with the café.

Looking forward to catching up outside of the office. Let me know if that time still works for you.

Best regards,
Alice
