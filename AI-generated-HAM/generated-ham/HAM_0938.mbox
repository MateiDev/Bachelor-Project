Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. As we approach the middle of the month, I'd like to schedule our next monthly team lunch.
Please let me know your availability next week so we can pick a date that works for everyone.
If you have any dietary restrictions or restaurant suggestions, feel free to share them.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying a meal together.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
