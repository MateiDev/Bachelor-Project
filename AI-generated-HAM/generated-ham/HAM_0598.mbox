Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well! With summer right around the corner, I thought it would be a great idea for us to have a team picnic. Here are the initial details:

Date: Saturday, July 6, 2024
Time: 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM
Location: Riverside Park, Shelter B

I've reserved Shelter B at Riverside Park, which has picnic tables, a grill area, and open space for games. Please let me know by Friday, June 21 if you will be able to join so I can finalize the headcount for food and supplies.

If you have any food preferences or dietary restrictions, drop me a quick note. We plan to have sandwiches, salads, fruit platters, and beverages, but suggestions are always welcome. Also, if anyone wants to bring a side dish or dessert to share, that would be fantastic.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon outdoors!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
