Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! With summer in full swing, I thought it would be fun to organize a neighborhood potluck picnic this Saturday at Riverside Park. It’ll be a casual afternoon—just good food, friendly faces, and maybe a frisbee game or two.

Would you be able to bring something? We need a variety of salads, side dishes, or even desserts. Let me know what you’d like to contribute, and I’ll add it to the list so we don’t end up with five fruit salads. Feel free to bring blankets or lawn chairs.

We’ll aim to start around 1:00 PM by the big oak tree near the playground. If the weather looks iffy, I’ll send an update by Friday evening.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
