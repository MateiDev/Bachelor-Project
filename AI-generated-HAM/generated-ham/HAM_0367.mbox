Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. I'm finalizing details for the picnic this Saturday. We'll meet at Riverside Park near the east entrance. I'll bring sandwiches, fruit, and drinks. Could you bring some snacks and a blanket? The forecast looks sunny and warm.

Let's meet at 11:00 AM. I'll reserve a picnic table. Feel free to bring any games you'd like.

See you this weekend!

Best,
Alice
