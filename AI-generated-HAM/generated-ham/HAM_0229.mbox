Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. Our next lunchtime book club meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, July 3rd at 12:30 PM in the cafeteria. We’ll be discussing “The Midnight Library” by Matt Haig.

Please RSVP by Friday so I can reserve enough seating and order refreshments. If you have any dietary preferences or suggestions for our next book selection, let me know.

Looking forward to another great discussion!

Best regards,
Alice
