Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. I wanted to confirm our plans for the weekend hiking trip. Here's what I suggest:
- Meet at my place at 7:30 AM on Saturday.
- We'll carpool and pick up Lisa along the way.
- The trailhead at Pine Ridge Park is about an hour from here.
- I'll bring snacks: granola bars, trail mix, and water.
- Maybe pack a light lunch; subs from the deli near my office would be great.

Let me know if this works for you or if you have any other ideas. Looking forward to exploring the North Loop trail together!

Best,
Alice
