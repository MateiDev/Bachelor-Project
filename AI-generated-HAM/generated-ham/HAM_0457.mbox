Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about the hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks great, with sunny skies and mild temperatures.

Here are a few details I’ve put together:
- Date: Saturday, March 18
- Meeting point: Pinewood Trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM
- Estimated duration: 6–7 hours, including breaks
- Difficulty: Moderate (some uphill sections)

Please bring:
- Plenty of water and snacks
- Comfortable hiking boots
- Sunscreen and a hat
- A light jacket in case it gets breezy

Let me know if you need a ride or if you’ll meet us there. If you have any other suggestions for the route or stops along the way, feel free to share. I’m excited to get out on the trail and enjoy the fresh air!

Looking forward to it,
Alice Johnson
