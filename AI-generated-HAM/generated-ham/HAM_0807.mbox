Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. As discussed in our last meeting, we’re organizing a team picnic next Friday, June 14th, at Riverside Park. Here are the details:

  * Time: 12:00 PM – 5:00 PM
  * Location: Riverside Park, Shelter #4
  * Activities: Frisbee, volleyball, board games, and a nature walk
  * Food: We’ll provide sandwiches, snacks, and drinks. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions.

Please RSVP by Tuesday, June 11th, so we can finalize catering. Feel free to bring family members or a friend. Also, if you have any game suggestions or can help with setup, let me know.

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best regards,
Alice
