Subject: Weekend Picnic Plans

Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Just wanted to touch base about our picnic this Sunday at Lakeside Park. The weather forecast looks sunny and mild—perfect for an afternoon outdoors.

Here’s what I have in mind:
- I'll bring sandwiches (vegetarian and turkey).
- Please bring your favorite snacks or sides.
- Don't forget a blanket or two for us to sit on.
- I’ll pick up some drinks; let me know if you prefer iced tea or lemonade.

Let me know if you have any other ideas or dietary preferences. We’re aiming to start around 11:30 AM by the west pavilion. Parking should be available just across the main entrance.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the sunshine!

Best,
Alice
