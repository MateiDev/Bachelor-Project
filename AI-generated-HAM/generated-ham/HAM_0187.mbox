Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm going to be in the office downtown tomorrow and thought it would be great to catch up over lunch. Are you available around 12:30 PM? There's a new Italian deli on 5th Street that has excellent panini and salads.

Let me know if that works or if you have another spot in mind.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
