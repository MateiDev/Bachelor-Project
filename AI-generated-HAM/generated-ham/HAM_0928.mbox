Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our plans for the weekend. The local hiking club is organizing a trip to Bear Mountain on Saturday morning. The trail starts at 8:30 AM, and it’s about a 5-mile loop with some scenic overlooks.

Here’s a rough plan:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:15 AM
- Bring snacks, water, and sturdy shoes
- We should be back by early afternoon

Let me know if you can make it or if you need a ride. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some fresh air!

Best,
Alice Johnson
