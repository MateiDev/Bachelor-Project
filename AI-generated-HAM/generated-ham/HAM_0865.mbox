Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to invite you and your family over for a backyard BBQ this Saturday, July 20th. We'll fire up the grill around 3 PM, and it should be a relaxed afternoon of good food and conversation.

We're planning to provide burgers, hot dogs, and veggie skewers. If you’d like to bring a side dish or dessert, that would be fantastic, but no pressure—just bring yourselves! Feel free to drop by anytime after 3 PM. Kids are welcome, and we'll have some yard games set up.

Let me know if you can make it, and if you have any dietary preferences. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
