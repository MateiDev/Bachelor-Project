Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I'd like to schedule a team lunch next week to catch up and celebrate our recent project milestones. Please reply with your availability on the following dates:

- Tuesday, October 10th, between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM
- Wednesday, October 11th, between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM
- Thursday, October 12th, between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM

Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, and I'll make sure to choose a restaurant that accommodates everyone. Once I have your responses, I'll send out a calendar invite with the confirmed time and location.

Looking forward to seeing you all and enjoying a nice break together!

Best regards,
Alice
