Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to finalize our plans for the weekend hike on Saturday. Here are the details so far:

Trailhead: Pine Ridge Park, Parking Lot B  
Meeting Time: 8:30 AM  
Estimated Duration: 5–6 hours  
Difficulty: Moderate (some rocky sections and a couple of steep inclines)  

What to bring:  
- Sturdy hiking boots  
- Plenty of water (at least 2 liters)  
- Snacks or a packed lunch  
- Sunscreen and hat  
- Light rain jacket (just in case)  
- Trekking poles (optional)  

Let me know if you’d like to carpool from my place (I can pick you up around 7:45 AM) or if you prefer to meet at the trailhead. Also, feel free to invite Sarah if she’s interested—there’s room in the car and she’s welcome to join!

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors. Let me know if any of these details need tweaking.

Best,
