Hello Bob,

Welcome to the July edition of our Gardening Club newsletter! We have a few exciting updates and tips to share:

1. Upcoming Summer Picnic
   Date: Saturday, July 22
   Time: 11:00 AM – 2:00 PM
   Location: Meadow Park Pavilion
   Please bring a dish to share and your favorite gardening book for our casual book swap.

2. Member Spotlight
   Congratulations to Maria Torres for her award-winning rose garden at the county fair! She’ll give a short presentation at our August meeting on hybrid rose care.

3. Tip of the Month: Mulching Tomatoes
   - Apply a 2–3 inch layer of organic mulch around your tomato plants.
   - This helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
   - Replenish mulch as needed throughout the season.

4. Seed Exchange Reminder
   We’ll have a seed exchange table at the picnic. Feel free to bring extra seeds from your harvest. Label cans with the plant name and growing instructions.

If you have questions or want to contribute ideas for future newsletters, just reply to this email. Looking forward to seeing everyone on the 22nd!

Best regards,
Alice Smith
