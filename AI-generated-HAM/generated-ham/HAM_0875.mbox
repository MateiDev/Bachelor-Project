Hi Team,

Just a friendly reminder that our company-sponsored team lunch is scheduled for Monday, June 19th at 12:30 PM in the downtown cafeteria. Please let me know by end of day Friday if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences so I can coordinate with catering.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best,
