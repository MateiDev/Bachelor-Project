Hello Team,

I hope you're all doing well. As discussed in our last meeting, let's have a team lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM at The Corner Cafe. They've got a great selection of sandwiches and salads. Please reply to let me know if you can join and if you have any dietary preferences.

Looking forward to catching up outside the office!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
