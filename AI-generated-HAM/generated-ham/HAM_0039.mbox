Hi John,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to confirm our team lunch plans for next Thursday, August 10. We've reserved a table at Bella's Bistro at 12:30 PM. The menu looks great, and they can accommodate vegetarian and gluten-free options.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if you'd prefer a different time. Also, feel free to suggest any other restaurants if you have any favorites.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
Sarah
