Subject: Team Project Update and Lunch Plans

Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to give you a quick update on the Henderson project before our meeting next week:

1. Design Phase Complete  
   - The mockups have been finalized and approved by the stakeholders.  
   - The development team has started integrating the new UI components.

2. Backend Integration  
   - API endpoints have been tested in the staging environment.  
   - Data migration scripts are ready for review.

3. Testing Schedule  
   - QA engineers will begin functional testing on Monday.  
   - We expect to start user acceptance testing (UAT) by July 30.

Also, I was thinking it would be nice to celebrate the completion of the design phase with a team lunch. Are you available this Wednesday at 12:30 PM? I was considering The Green Bistro downtown. Let me know if that works for you, or if you have another spot in mind.

Looking forward to your feedback on both the project update and lunch plans.

Best regards,
Alice
