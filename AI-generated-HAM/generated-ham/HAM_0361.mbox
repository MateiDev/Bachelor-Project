Hi Alex,

Hope you’re doing well! Just a heads-up that I’ll be in the office tomorrow around noon. Would you be up for grabbing lunch at the café downstairs? Thought it’d be a good chance to catch up and go over the new design mockups for our client. I’ve made a few tweaks based on last week’s feedback and have some questions about the color palette.

Let me know if that works for you. If not, we can reschedule for later in the week.

Enjoy the rest of your day!

Best,
Test
