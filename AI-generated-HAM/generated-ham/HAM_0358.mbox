Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! The weather forecast for this Saturday looks great, and I was thinking it would be the perfect day for our hiking trip up Pinecrest Trail. The trail is about 7 miles round trip, with some moderate climbs, but the views from the summit are totally worth it.

Here's what I have in mind:
- Meet at my place at 8:00 AM.
- Carpool to the trailhead (it's about a 45-minute drive).
- Bring packed lunches, water, and sun protection.
- Plan to be back by around 4:00 PM.

Let me know if that works for you or if youâ€™d prefer a different time. If you have any suggestions for snacks or stops along the way, feel free to share. Looking forward to catching up and getting some fresh air!

Best,
Alice Johnson
