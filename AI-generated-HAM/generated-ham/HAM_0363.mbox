Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Just a friendly reminder about our team lunch scheduled for this Friday, March 17th, at 12:30 PM. We'll be meeting at the new Italian bistro, La Pasta Bella, located at 123 Main Street.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if you need a ride from the office. Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best regards,
Alice
