Subject: Weekend Potluck Planning

Hi Bob,

I hope you’re having a great week! I’m writing to finalize plans for the neighborhood potluck this Saturday evening at our place. Here’s what I have so far:

- Main dishes:  
  • Grilled vegetable lasagna  
  • BBQ pulled pork  

- Salads:  
  • Greek salad with feta and olives (I’ll bring this)  
  • Quinoa and black bean salad  

- Desserts:  
  • Apple pie (Mom’s recipe)  
  • Chocolate brownies  

Could you let me know which item you’d like to bring? Also, we have plenty of drinks, but feel free to bring your favorite nonalcoholic punch if you’d like. The gathering starts at 5:00 PM, but drop off anytime after 4:00 PM works.

Address:  
123 Maple Street  
Oakwood, NY 10002

Feel free to park in the driveway or on the street. If you need anything special—like serving utensils, extra chairs, or a vegetarian option—just reply and I’ll make sure it’s covered.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone! Have a wonderful day, and let me know your dish soon.

Best,  
Alice
