Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As we discussed at the last team meeting, we'd like to organize a
summer picnic for the department. Here are the current details:

Date: Saturday, July 20, 2024
Time: 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM
Location: Lincoln Park, Shelter #5

We'll need volunteers to help with setting up tables, preparing snacks, and organizing games.
Could you please let me know which role you'd like to take on? Also, feel free to suggest any
special activities or dishes you'd like to contribute.

I'll send a follow-up email with a signup sheet and further logistics next week.

Thanks in advance for your help. Looking forward to a fun day!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
