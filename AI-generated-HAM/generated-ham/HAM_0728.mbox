Hello Team,

Thank you all for attending today’s design review meeting. Here’s a brief summary of the key points we covered:

1. UI Mockups:  
   - Approved the new dashboard layout with side navigation.  
   - Decided to use larger icons for better accessibility.

2. API Endpoints:  
   - Finalized the schema changes for the /user/profile and /orders endpoints.  
   - Agreed to update the documentation by end of day Friday.

3. Next Steps:  
   - Front-end team to implement the approved mockups.  
   - Back-end team to deploy the updated API on the staging server by Monday.  
   - QA to prepare test cases and begin preliminary testing once deployment is complete.

Please review these notes and let me know if I missed anything or if you have additional feedback. I’ll send out an updated task list after incorporating your comments.

Best regards,
Alice Smith
