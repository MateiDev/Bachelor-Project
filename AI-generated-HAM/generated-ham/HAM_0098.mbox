Hello Bob,

Thanks for the productive meeting yesterday. I've summarized the main points and action items below:

1. Project Timeline
   - Phase 1 completion: August 15
   - Phase 2 kickoff: August 20
2. Resource Allocation
   - John will handle UI design.
   - Maria will manage backend integration.
3. Client Feedback
   - They requested minor tweaks to the dashboard layout.
   - Approved the initial wireframes.

Next Steps:
- I'll send the revised wireframes by Friday.
- Schedule a follow-up call with the client for Monday at 10 AM.
- Update the project plan with the new dates.

Please let me know if you have any questions or additional input.

Best regards,
Alice
