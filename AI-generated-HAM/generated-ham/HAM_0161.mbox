Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check if you’d like to join the rest of the team for lunch next Tuesday at The Green Bistro. We’re planning to meet at 12:30 PM in the courtyard, weather permitting.

Please let me know if you can make it or if there’s a different spot you’d prefer. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Johnson
