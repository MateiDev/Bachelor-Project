Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well! With the second quarter wrapping up, it's time for our quarterly team outing. Here are the proposed options:

1. Kayaking on Lakeview River – Saturday, June 22
2. Hiking at Green Ridge Trails – Sunday, June 23
3. Picnic at Riverside Park – Saturday, June 22

Please reply with your preference by Friday, June 14. Once we have everyone's input, I'll book the venue and share the details.

Looking forward to spending some time together outside the office!

Best,
John
