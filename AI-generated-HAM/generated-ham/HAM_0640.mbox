Hi Team,

I hope everyone had a great week. Here’s a quick update on our current projects:

- Project Phoenix: The design phase is nearly complete. We’ll start development next Monday.
- Marketing Campaign: Drafts for social media posts have been shared. Please review by Wednesday.
- QA Testing: The test environment is scheduled for maintenance on Thursday; expect limited access between 2 PM and 4 PM.

Action Items:
1. Review and comment on the social media drafts.
2. Prepare your weekly status reports by end of day Wednesday.
3. Confirm availability for the development kickoff meeting on Monday at 9 AM.

Let me know if you have any questions or need assistance with your tasks. Enjoy your weekend!

Best regards,
