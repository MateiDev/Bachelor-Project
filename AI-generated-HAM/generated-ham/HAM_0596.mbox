Hi Bob,

Thank you for taking the time to meet this morning. I enjoyed our discussion about the upcoming project and wanted to summarize the key points:

  * Project timeline: Kickoff on June 10th, with milestones every two weeks.
  * Roles: You will handle the design mockups; I will coordinate development.
  * Resources: We agreed to request access to the shared design assets folder.
  * Next steps: Schedule a team-wide kickoff call and send out invitations.

Please let me know if I missed anything or if you have any questions. Iâ€™ll draft the project plan and share it by the end of the day tomorrow.

Looking forward to working together!

Best regards,
Alice
