Hello John,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share the final details for our community summer picnic next Saturday, June 22nd. We'll gather at Lakeside Park Pavilion #3 starting at 11:00 AM. Here's a quick rundown:

  * Location: Lakeside Park, Pavilion #3 (near the east parking lot)  
  * Time: 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM  
  * Activities: Frisbee, relay races, kids' face painting, and a community potluck  
  * What to bring: A dish to share, your own beverages, and lawn chairs or blankets  

Volunteers will begin setting up at 9:30 AM, so feel free to arrive early if you'd like to help. Weâ€™re also arranging games and music equipment. If you have any suggestions or need special accommodations, let me know by Wednesday.

Please RSVP by replying to this email so we can finalize the headcount. Looking forward to a fun day with everyone!

Best regards,
Jane Doe
