Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well and enjoying the summer weather. I wanted to invite you to a relaxed garden get-together at my place this Saturday afternoon. I’ll be firing up the barbecue around 4 PM and setting out some cold drinks and snacks. Feel free to bring along anything special you’d like to grill or share.

We’ll have a few lawn games and some acoustic guitar music for those who’d like to play. If you have any dietary preferences, let me know so I can prepare accordingly. Also, Eleanor and Jason from our book club are planning to stop by, and they’d love to see you.

Let me know if you can make it, and I’ll send you my address and directions. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
