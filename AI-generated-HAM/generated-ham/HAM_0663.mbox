Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this coming Saturday.

Here are the details we discussed:
- Meeting point: Pine Valley Trailhead parking lot
- Time: 8:00 AM (please aim to arrive by 7:45 AM)
- Trail difficulty: Moderate, approximately 6 miles round-trip
- What to bring:
  * Comfortable hiking shoes
  * Water (at least 2 liters)
  * Snacks or a light lunch
  * Layers for changing weather
  * Sunscreen and a hat

Let me know if you need a ride or if anything has changed on your end. The forecast looks clear, but I’ll check again Friday evening and send an update if needed.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some fresh air.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
