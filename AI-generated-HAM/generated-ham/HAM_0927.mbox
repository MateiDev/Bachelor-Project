Hi everyone,

Just a friendly reminder that our next Book Club meeting is coming up on Monday, July 15th at 7:00 PM at the Downtown Library Conference Room B.

We’ll be discussing Erin Morgenstern’s “The Night Circus.” Feel free to bring your favorite quotes or themes for discussion. Here’s a quick outline for the evening:

1. Welcome and informal chat (7:00 – 7:10 PM)
2. Key plot points and character analysis (7:10 – 7:40 PM)
3. Thematic deep dive: magic, love, and competition (7:40 – 8:10 PM)
4. Open discussion and personal reflections (8:10 – 8:40 PM)
5. Book suggestions for next month (8:40 – 9:00 PM)

Snacks and beverages will be provided. If you have any dietary restrictions, please let me know by tomorrow afternoon so I can make arrangements.

Looking forward to seeing you all and hearing your thoughts on this enchanting novel!

Best regards,
Tim
