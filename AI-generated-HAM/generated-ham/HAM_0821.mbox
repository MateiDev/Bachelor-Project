Hi John,

I hope you’re doing well. Ahead of our team meeting on Monday, I wanted to share a draft agenda:

1. Project Updates
2. Timeline Review
3. Resource Allocation
4. New Feature Discussion
5. Q&A

Please let me know if you’d like to add any items or modify the order. I plan to circulate the final agenda by end of day tomorrow.

Looking forward to a productive session.

Best regards,
Jane
