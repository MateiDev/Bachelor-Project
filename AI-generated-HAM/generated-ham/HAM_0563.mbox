Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about the picnic this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great, with sunny skies and mild temperatures.

Here's what I have planned:
- Location: Riverside Park, by the oak grove
- Time: 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM
- Food: I'll bring sandwiches, fruit salad, and lemonade. Feel free to bring any snacks or desserts you like.
- Activities: Frisbee, card games, and a short nature walk.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or if you'd prefer a different time. I'm really looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors.

Thanks,
Alice Johnson
