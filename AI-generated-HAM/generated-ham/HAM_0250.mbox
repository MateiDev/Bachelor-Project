Hi Bob,

Just a quick reminder about our team lunch scheduled for next Thursday at 12:30 PM at the Italian Bistro on Main Street. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences.

Also, I've attached the draft agenda for next weekâ€™s project planning meeting. Feel free to review it and suggest any additional topics.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
