Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to remind you about the team outing next Friday, July 7th. We'll be meeting at 10:00 AM in the lobby and heading to Riverside Park for a picnic. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or any other preferences.

Looking forward to a fun day with everyone!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
