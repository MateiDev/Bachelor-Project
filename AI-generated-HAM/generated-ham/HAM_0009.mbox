Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm organizing a short planning session for our upcoming team
picnic next week. I'd like to discuss the location, food options, budget, and activities.
Are you available for a quick meeting on Monday at 2:00 PM in the 3rd-floor conference
room? If that doesn't work, let me know your availability, and we'll find another time.

I've created a shared document where we can list ideas:

Please add any suggestions you have before the meeting. Looking forward to making this
event a success!

Thanks,
Alice Johnson
