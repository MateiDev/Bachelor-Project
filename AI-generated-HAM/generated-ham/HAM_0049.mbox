Hi Bob,

Just a quick reminder about our community picnic this Saturday at Riverview Park. I’m compiling the recipe list for our potluck. So far, we have:

• Grilled Veggie Skewers (Sam)
• Fresh Fruit Salad (Maria)
• Lemonade (Derek)

Would you like to contribute? I remember you mentioned your famous spinach-artichoke dip. Feel free to bring that, or any dessert you like!

Also, we’ll set up around 1 PM near the north shelter. If you need help carrying dishes or setting up chairs, let me know. Looking forward to a fun afternoon with everyone.

Best,
Alice Johnson
