Hi Bob,

Hope you’re doing well! I wanted to see if you’d be interested in grabbing lunch this Thursday around 12:30 PM. There’s a new café on Main Street that just opened, and I’ve heard good things about their paninis. It would be great to catch up and chat about the upcoming project milestones.

Let me know if that works for you or if another time is better. Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
