Hey Jane,

Just wanted to touch base about our picnic plans for this weekend. The weather forecast looks great, so I’m thinking Saturday afternoon at Riverside Park around 1:00 PM. I’ll bring sandwiches and lemonade—would you like to handle snacks or desserts?

Also, we could play frisbee or take a short hike along the river trail if you’re up for it. Let me know what you think or if you have any other ideas. I’m really looking forward to catching up outside of the daily routine!

Hope you’re doing well. See you soon!

Best,
John
