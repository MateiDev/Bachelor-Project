Hi Bob,

I'm really looking forward to our hike this weekend! Here are the details:

Date: Saturday, July 27th  
Time: 8:00 AM meet-up  
Location: Bear Mountain State Park, Trailhead parking lot  
Trail: Perkins Memorial Tower Loop (approx. 5 miles)  
Difficulty: Moderate  

Please bring:  
- At least 2 liters of water  
- Snacks or a packed lunch  
- Comfortable hiking shoes  
- Sunscreen and a hat  
- A light jacket (it can be cooler up top)

I'll be driving and have space for two more if you'd like to carpool. Let me know if you need directions or have any dietary preferences for snacks. I'm planning to bring my camera to grab some scenic shots!

See you soon and have a great week!

Cheers,
Alice
