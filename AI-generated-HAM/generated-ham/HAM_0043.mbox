Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to remind you about our team outing this Friday at Riverside Park. We’ll meet at the main entrance at 11:30 AM, and then grab lunch at the picnic area. Feel free to bring any of your favorite board games or a frisbee.

If you have any dietary restrictions or need transportation, let me know so I can make the necessary arrangements. The weather forecast looks clear, but I’ll send an update in case anything changes.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon together!

Best,
Alice Johnson
