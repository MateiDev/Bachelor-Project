Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. The team was talking about organizing a lunch next week to celebrate the successful launch of the new website. We were thinking of meeting on Wednesday, May 1st, around 12:30 PM.

Would you be interested in joining us? If so, do you have any restaurant suggestions nearby the downtown office? The budget per person is around $20â€“25, so casual spots would be perfect.

Let me know what you think, and feel free to propose any dates or locations that work best for you. Looking forward to catching up outside the office!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
