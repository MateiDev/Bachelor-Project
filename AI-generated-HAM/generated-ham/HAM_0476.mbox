Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to see if you’re free this Saturday for a morning hike with our group. We’re planning to head to Pine Ridge Trail, which is about a 30-minute drive from town. It’s a moderately easy trail (around 5 miles round trip), and the weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with a light breeze.

Here’s the tentative schedule:
- 8:00 AM: Meet at my place (123 Elm Street)
- 8:30 AM: Depart for Pine Ridge Trail
- 9:00 AM: Start hike
- 12:30 PM: Return and grab lunch at the Lakeside Café

Feel free to bring water, snacks, and comfortable shoes. If you have any questions or need a ride, just let me know. It’ll be a great chance to catch up and enjoy the outdoors.

Looking forward to your reply!

Cheers,
Alice
