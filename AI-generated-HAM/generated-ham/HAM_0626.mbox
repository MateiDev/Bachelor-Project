Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about our plan to go hiking this weekend. The weather forecast looks great, with sunny skies and mild temperatures. I found a trail at Pine Ridge Park that has some beautiful scenic overlooks and a small lake at the halfway point.

If you're up for it, we could meet at the park entrance around 8:00 AM on Saturday. That should give us enough time to hike and enjoy a picnic lunch by the lake before heading back mid-afternoon. Let me know if that works for you or if you have any other suggestions.

Looking forward to catching up and spending some time outdoors!

Best,
Alice
