Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Please find below the agenda for our upcoming team meeting scheduled on Thursday, April 25 at 2:00 PM:

1. Project Alpha status update
2. Discussion on client feedback received last week
3. Planning for the next sprint
4. Resource allocation and workload balancing
5. Any other business

Let me know if you would like to add any additional topics to the agenda. Otherwise, I'll assume this covers everything and will circulate the finalized agenda by Wednesday afternoon.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
Alice
