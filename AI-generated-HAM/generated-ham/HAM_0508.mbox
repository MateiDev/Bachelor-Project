Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks promising, with mostly sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-70s.

Here’s a rough itinerary:
- Saturday morning: Meet at the trailhead by 8:00 AM.  
- Midday: Break for lunch at the overlook point (I’ll bring sandwiches and snacks).  
- Afternoon: Continue along the ridge trail, aiming to finish by 4:00 PM.  
- Evening: Set up camp near Pine Lake; I’ll bring the camp stove and cooking gear.  

For Sunday, we can either:
1) Hike to the waterfall loop (about 5 miles round trip) and return by early afternoon  
2) Pack up camp and take the scenic Roadview Trail, which is slightly shorter, then head home  

Please let me know which option you prefer. Also, if you have any dietary restrictions or additional gear requests, just tell me and I’ll make sure to pack accordingly.  

Looking forward to getting some fresh air and catching up!  

Best,  
Alice
