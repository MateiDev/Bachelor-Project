Hi Bob,

Just wanted to follow up on our plans for the hiking trip this Saturday. The forecast looks great, with clear skies and mild temperatures. I’ve checked the trailhead conditions, and there's plenty of parking available. I'll bring sandwiches and snacks; could you take care of the water and the trail map?

Let's meet at the parking lot by 8:00 AM so we can start early. Feel free to adjust the plan if you have any ideas—for example, we could extend the loop to include the waterfall lookout if we finish ahead of schedule.

Looking forward to some fresh air and good company.

Best,
Alice
