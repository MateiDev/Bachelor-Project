Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share the preliminary agenda for our team meeting this Friday at 2 PM:

1. Project Alpha status update  
2. Review of recent client feedback  
3. Upcoming milestones and deadlines  
4. Resource allocation for next sprint  
5. Open discussion / Q&A  

Please let me know if there are any other topics you’d like to add. I’ll circulate the final agenda by Thursday afternoon.

Best regards,
Alice
