Hi Mary,

Thanks for organizing the team lunch tomorrow. I'm looking forward to catching up with everyone. Are we still meeting at the cafe on Main Street at 12:30 PM? If so, I can pick up the reservation confirmation slip on my way.

Also, Alex mentioned they would bring the photo album from last quarter's events. It should be fun to reminisce.

Let me know if there's anything I can do before then.

Best,
John
