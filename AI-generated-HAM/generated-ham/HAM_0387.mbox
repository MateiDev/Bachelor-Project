Dear Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to remind you about our next community garden meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, June 12 at 6:30 PM at the Greenway Community Center. We'll be discussing the summer planting schedule, watering rotation, and plans for the upcoming neighborhood open house.

Agenda:
- Welcome and introductions
- Summer planting overview
- Volunteer schedule and responsibilities
- Open house logistics
- Q&A

Please let me know if you have any items to add or if you'll be unable to attend. Your contributions have been invaluable, and we look forward to seeing you there.

Best regards,
Alice
