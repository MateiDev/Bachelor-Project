Hi Bob,

Just wanted to remind everyone that the team meetup is scheduled for this Saturday at 10:00 AM
at the Lakeside Community Center. It will be a great opportunity for team building and
to discuss our Q3 goals in a relaxed environment.

Agenda:
1. Welcome and breakfast.
2. Review of last quarter achievements.
3. Brainstorming session for upcoming projects.
4. Lunch and informal networking.

If you need any assistance with transportation or have dietary preferences for lunch, please let
me know by Thursday end of day.

Looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the team there!

Best regards,
Alice Smith
