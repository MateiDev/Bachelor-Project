Subject: Team Lunch on Friday

Hello Bob,

I'm writing to remind you about our team lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM. We'll be meeting at The Green Garden on Elm Street. Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if the time doesn't work for you.

Also, the quarterly report draft is due next Monday. If you'd like me to review it beforehand, just send it over by end of day Friday.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
