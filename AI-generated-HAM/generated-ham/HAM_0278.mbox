Hey Bob,

Hope you’re doing well! I was thinking about our conversation last week regarding the hiking trail up at Pine Ridge. The weather forecast looks perfect for this Saturday—sunny with temperatures in the mid-70s.

I found a trail map online that covers the 8-mile loop. It starts near the old ranger station, so parking should be easy. We can meet at my place around 8:00 AM, caravan up together, and maybe stop for coffee on the way.

Let me know if that works for you. Feel free to bring any snacks or gear you think we might need. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some fresh air!

Cheers,
Alice
