Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check if you'd be available for a lunch meeting next Wednesday to discuss the upcoming project timeline. We could meet at the cafe downstairs around 12:30 PM.

Please let me know if that works for you or suggest another time that better fits your schedule.

Looking forward to catching up.

Best regards,
John
