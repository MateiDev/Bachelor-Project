Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I'm writing to confirm the details for our weekend hiking trip.

Date: Saturday, November 4th
Meeting Time: 7:30 AM
Meeting Place: Main parking lot at Pine Ridge Trailhead
Expected Return: Around 5:00 PM

Trail Difficulty: Moderate (about 8 miles round trip, with some elevation gain)
What to Bring:
- Sturdy hiking boots
- Water bottle or hydration pack (at least 2 liters)
- Snacks or a packed lunch
- Weather-appropriate layers (it may be chilly in the morning)
- Sunscreen and sunglasses
- Small first-aid kit

I'll bring a lightweight camp stove to make hot cocoa at the summit. If you have any dietary preferences, let me know so I can pack something suitable. Also, feel free to bring a camera if you’d like—I've heard the view of the valley is especially beautiful at this time of year.

Please reply if you need to adjust the meeting time or if you have any questions. Looking forward to hitting the trails together!

Best,
Alice
