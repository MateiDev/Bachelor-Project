Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder about our monthly team lunch tomorrow at 12:30 PM.
We’ll meet at The Green Leaf Cafe in Building 5. It’ll be a great chance to
catch up with the team and discuss upcoming projects in a relaxed setting.

If you have any dietary preferences or need to adjust the time, let me know
by end of day today.

See you there!

Best,
Alice
