Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our plans for the hike this Saturday morning. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with a high of 60°F—and I think it’ll be a perfect day to get out on the trail.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM.
- Bring water (at least two liters), snacks, and comfortable hiking shoes.
- We can take the Ridge View Loop, which is about 7 miles and offers some nice overlooks.
- I’ll pack some sandwiches and granola bars; feel free to bring anything else you’d like.

Let me know if the time works for you or if you’d prefer to start a bit earlier or later. Also, if you have any other trail suggestions, I’m open to switching it up.

Looking forward to getting some fresh air and catching up!

Best,
Alice
