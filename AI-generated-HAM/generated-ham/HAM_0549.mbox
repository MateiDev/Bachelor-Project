Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to see if you’re free for lunch sometime this week. I was thinking about trying out that new café on Maple Street—The Green Spoon. They have a great selection of salads, sandwiches, and a rotating soup of the day. 

If you’re up for something different, there’s also Bella Pizzeria, which just reopened after renovations. Their wood-fired pizzas have excellent reviews, and they offer several vegetarian options. Let me know what sounds best to you, and what day works.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
