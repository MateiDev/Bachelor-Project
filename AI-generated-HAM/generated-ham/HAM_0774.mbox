Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, the team has been
working really hard over the past few weeks. To show our appreciation, I'd like to
organize a team lunch next Wednesday, March 22nd, at 12:30 PM. I was thinking
of trying out the new cafe downtown called "Green Leaf Bistro."

Could you let me know if that date and time works for you? If you have any dietary
restrictions or preferences, please mention them and I'll make sure we pick suitable
options for everyone.

Looking forward to your reply!

Best regards,
Alice Smith
