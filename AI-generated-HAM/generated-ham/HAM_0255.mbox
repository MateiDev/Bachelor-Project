Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Are you free this weekend? I was thinking of going for a day hike at Bear Mountain on Saturday morning. The weather forecast looks great, with sunny skies and mild temperatures.

We could meet around 8:00 AM at the trailhead. Let me know if that works for you, and if you need a ride. I can pick you up on my way.

Also, don't forget to bring plenty of water, snacks, and your cameraâ€”there are some amazing views at the summit.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
