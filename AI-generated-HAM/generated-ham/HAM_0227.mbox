Hello everyone,

Just a friendly reminder that our annual Summer Potluck is coming up this Saturday, August 5th, at 4:00 PM in the Riverside Park picnic area. Please bring a dish to share—anything from salads and sandwiches to desserts and drinks. If you have a picnic blanket or folding chairs, feel free to bring those as well.

We’ll have some games set up for kids and adults alike, so don’t forget your competitive spirit! If you’d like to volunteer to help with setup or cleanup, let me know by replying to this email.

Feel free to invite any friends or neighbors who might be interested—everyone is welcome. Looking forward to seeing you all there for good food, fun, and community spirit!

Best regards,
Alice
