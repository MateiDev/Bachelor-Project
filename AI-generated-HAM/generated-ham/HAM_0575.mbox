Hello Bob,

Hope you’re doing well. I wanted to check if you’re available this Friday at noon for our team lunch at the new café on Main Street. They have good vegetarian options and outdoor seating.

Please let me know if that works for you or if you have any dietary preferences I should pass along to the restaurant.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
Alice
