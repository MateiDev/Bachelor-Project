Hi Bob,

Happy New Year! I hope you had a great holiday season.

I was thinking it would be nice to catch up over lunch sometime next week. Are you free on Wednesday or Thursday around noon? There's a new cafe downtown that just opened â€“ I heard they have excellent sandwiches.

Let me know what works best for you. Looking forward to hearing about your break and sharing updates on the project.

Best,
Alice
