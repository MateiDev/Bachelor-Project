Hi Jane,

Thank you for your input during yesterday's project meeting. I've summarized the key points below:

1. Finalize the draft of the proposal by Monday, October 16.
2. Coordinate with the design team to update the mockups.
3. Schedule a follow-up call with the finance department for budget approval.
4. Prepare the presentation slides and share them with the team by Friday.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional resources. Let's aim to have all deliverables ready before the end of next week.

Best regards,
John
