Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to check if you’re available for lunch next week. I found a new café downtown that serves great sandwiches and salads. Would Wednesday or Thursday around 12:30 PM work for you? Let me know what your schedule looks like, and I’ll make a reservation.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
