Hi Alice,

I hope you’re doing well! It’s been a while since our last catch-up. I wanted to see if you’re interested in joining me for a day hike this Saturday at Pine Ridge Trail. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with mild temperatures.

I’m planning to leave around 8:00 AM from the trailhead parking lot. It’s about a 5-mile loop, moderate difficulty, with some great views of the river valley. I’ll bring sandwiches, snacks, and plenty of water. Feel free to pack anything else you might like, such as fruit or energy bars.

Let me know if you can make it. If Saturday doesn’t work, I’m also free Sunday morning. Either way, it’d be great to spend some time outdoors and catch up.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Charlie
