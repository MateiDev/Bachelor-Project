Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to let you know that we’re organizing a casual potluck this Saturday at Oakwood Park, starting around noon. It’s a great opportunity to catch up with friends and enjoy some fresh air.

If you can make it, please bring a dish to share—anything from sandwiches or salads to cookies or fruit. We’ll have picnic blankets and a small portable speaker for some background music. Feel free to invite anyone you’d like; the more the merrier.

Let me know what you plan to bring so we can coordinate and avoid duplicates. Looking forward to a fun afternoon!

Best,
Alice
