Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. It's been a while since our last catch-up. I wanted to see if you'd be interested in going on a hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks great, and Bear Mountain has some scenic trails we haven't tried yet.

Let me know if Saturday morning works for you. I can drive, and we can pack a lunch to enjoy at the summit. Should be a fun day outdoors!

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,
Alice
