Hi John,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to check in about our weekend hiking trip this coming Saturday. Here are a few quick details:

• Meeting point: Pine Ridge Trailhead at 9:00 AM  
• Expected duration: 6–7 hours, including breaks  
• Weather forecast: Sunny with highs around 75°F  
• Packing list: water, snacks, sunscreen, hat, sturdy shoes  

Let me know if that schedule still works for you or if you’d prefer to start a bit earlier. Also, feel free to suggest any additional snacks or games we should bring along.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Best regards,
