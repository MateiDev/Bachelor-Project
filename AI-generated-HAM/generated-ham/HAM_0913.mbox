Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. The team has been discussing getting together for lunch next Tuesday, June 20th, at the new café downtown—The Garden Bistro. It’s supposed to have a great outdoor patio and a varied menu (salads, sandwiches, and a few daily specials).

We’d love for you to join us at 12:30 PM. Let me know if that works with your schedule, or if you have any dietary preferences we should pass along to the restaurant.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
