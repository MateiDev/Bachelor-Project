Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to see if you’re interested in joining me and a few friends for a picnic at Greenwood Park this Saturday afternoon. We’re planning to meet around 11:30 AM near the gazebo by the lake.

Here’s a rough plan:
- 11:30 AM: Gather at the gazebo
- 12:00 PM: Enjoy sandwiches, salads, and snacks
- 1:00 PM: Play frisbee or board games
- 3:00 PM: Take a stroll on the nature trail
- 4:00 PM: Wrap up and say goodbye

Feel free to bring anything you’d like to share—drinks, desserts, or outdoor games. The weather forecast looks sunny and warm, so it should be a great day to relax outside.

Let me know if you can make it and if you have any dietary preferences or suggestions. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
John
