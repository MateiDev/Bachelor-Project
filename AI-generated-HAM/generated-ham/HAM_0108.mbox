Hey Emily,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our plans for the hiking trip this Saturday. The weather forecast looks clear with highs around 55°F, so it should be perfect for the ridge trail. 

Here's the tentative schedule:
- 8:00 AM: Meet at Pinecrest Trailhead parking lot
- 8:15 AM: Begin ascent to Eagle’s Peak
- 12:00 PM: Lunch break at the summit (I’ll pack sandwiches and hot cocoa)
- 1:00 PM: Head down via the north loop
- 4:00 PM: Return to trailhead

Please bring:
- Sturdy hiking boots
- Water (at least 2 liters)
- Layers (it can be chilly at higher elevation)
- Sunglasses and sunscreen
- Any favorite snacks

Let me know if the timing works for you or if you’d like to adjust anything. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the views!

Best,
Joe Smith
