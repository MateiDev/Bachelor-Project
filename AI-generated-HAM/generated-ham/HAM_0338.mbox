Hey Bob,

Just a friendly reminder about the potluck this Sunday at 3:00 PM at my place (123 Maple Street). Feel free to bring your famous guacamole or any dessert you prefer. Also, let me know if you'll need parkingâ€”there's a spot reserved in the driveway.

Looking forward to catching up with you and the gang. It's been too long since our last barbecue!

Cheers,
Alice
