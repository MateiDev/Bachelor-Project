Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Are you still up for our weekend hike? 
The forecast looks great for Saturday morning. I was thinking we could 
start around 8:00 AM at the trailhead by Pine Valley. It's about a 
3-mile loop, so we should be back before noon.

Let me know if you need a ride or if that time works for you. I can
bring some snacks and water for us, too.

Looking forward to it!

Cheers,
Alice
