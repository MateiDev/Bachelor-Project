Hey Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! Just wanted to send you the final details for our weekend hiking trip:

- Meeting Point: Pine Ridge Trailhead at 8:00 AM on Saturday  
- Gear Checklist:  
  * Sturdy hiking boots  
  * Water bottles (at least 2 liters)  
  * Packed lunch and snacks  
  * Lightweight rain jacket  
  * Sunscreen and sunglasses  
  * First-aid kit  

The trail is about 10 miles round-trip, with some moderate elevation gain. We should be back by mid-afternoon. I’ll bring extra trail mix and a small portable grill if we decide to stop by the creek for lunch.

Let me know if you need me to pick you up or if you have any questions. Looking forward to a great day out in nature!

Cheers,  
Alice Johnson
