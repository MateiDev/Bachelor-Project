Hi Alice,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our summer picnic next month.
It's been a while since we all got together, and I thought the end of August
would be perfect timing.

I've reserved a spot at Lakeside Park on Saturday, August 24th, starting at noon.
Could you let me know if that works for you? Also, if you have any suggestions for
activities or food contributions, just reply to this email and I'll add them to
our planning document.

So far, Sarah is bringing sandwiches, Mike is handling beverages, and I'll take
care of the desserts. Feel free to bring along any games or your new outdoor
speaker if you'd like.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the sunshine!

Best,
Bob
