Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base regarding our marketing project due next week. I've updated the draft with the latest campaign ideas below. Could you take a look and let me know if you have any feedback? I'm free to meet after lunch today if that works for you.

1. Social media teaser posts for Instagram and Twitter.
2. Sponsored newsletter segment.
3. Influencer partnership guidelines.
4. Email drip campaign schedule.

Also, are we still on for the client call this Friday at 3 PM? I've reserved the conference room on the third floor.

By the way, a few of us are going to grab lunch at the new cafe around the corner at 12:30. Feel free to join!

Best,
Alice
