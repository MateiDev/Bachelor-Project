Hi John,

I hope you're doing well. Just a quick note to confirm our team lunch this Friday at noon. We'll be meeting at The Green Bistro on 5th Avenueâ€”it's the place with the outdoor patio and fresh seasonal menu.

Agenda:
- Quick project updates
- Brainstorming ideas for the next sprint
- Any other business

Feel free to let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if you'd prefer a different spot. Otherwise, I'll make a reservation for six people at 12:00 PM.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best regards,
Alice
