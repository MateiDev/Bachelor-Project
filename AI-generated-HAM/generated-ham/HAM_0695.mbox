Subject: Lunch Plans for Next Tuesday

Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great weekend. I wanted to touch base about our team's informal get-together next Tuesday. We've reserved a table at the new Italian restaurant downtown for 12:30 PM. Would you be able to join us?

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if you need a different time. Looking forward to catching up outside the office.

Best regards,

Alice
