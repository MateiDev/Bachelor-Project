Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! Just a reminder about the potluck party this Saturday at my place. We’ll start around 3:00 PM. If you’d like, bring your famous potato salad or anything else you enjoy making.

Here’s a quick list of what everyone’s bringing:
- Sarah: Deviled eggs
- Michael: Fresh lemonade
- Jenna: Chocolate brownies
- David: Garden salad

Feel free to arrive a bit early if you want to help set up. Also, let me know if you need directions or have any special dietary requests.

Looking forward to seeing you!

Best,
Alice
