Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to check in about our plans for this weekend.
The forecast is looking great on Saturday, with sunny skies and mild temperatures.
I was thinking we could start at 8 AM, meet at the trailhead parking lot near Pine Ridge.
The loop is about 7 miles and offers some fantastic views of the river valley.

I've packed sandwiches, fruit, and plenty of water. Let me know if you'd like
to bring anything specificâ€”maybe some trail mix or extra snacks. Also, I can
drive if that's more convenient; just let me know.

Looking forward to getting out in nature and catching up.

Best,
Alice
