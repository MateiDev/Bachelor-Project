Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share the details for our upcoming summer team picnic next Saturday:

Date: Saturday, July 20, 2024  
Time: 11:00 AM – 4:00 PM  
Location: Pine Grove Park, Shelter #3  
Address: 1234 Maple Lane, Springfield

Agenda:  
- 11:00 AM: Arrive and set up  
- 12:00 PM: Lunch buffet (sandwiches, salads, fruit, drinks)  
- 1:30 PM: Team games and activities (volleyball, corn hole, trivia)

What to bring:  
- Sunscreen and a hat  
- Lawn chairs or picnic blanket  
- Any personal games or sports equipment you’d like to share

Please RSVP by Wednesday, July 17, so I can confirm numbers with the catering team. If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, let me know and I’ll make sure we have options available.

Looking forward to seeing everyone outside of the office! It’ll be a great opportunity to relax and catch up.

Best regards,

Alice
