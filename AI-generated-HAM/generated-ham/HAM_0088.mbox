Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Just a friendly reminder about our lunch meeting this Friday
at 12:30 PM at the Corner Bistro. I'm looking forward to catching up and discussing
the upcoming project milestones.

Please let me know if anything changes or if you need to adjust the time.

See you then!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
