Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Our team is planning to have a casual lunch next Wednesday, July 24th, at 12:30 PM at The Green Cafe downtown. It would be great if you could join us. Let me know if that time works for you or if you have any dietary restrictions we should keep in mind.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
