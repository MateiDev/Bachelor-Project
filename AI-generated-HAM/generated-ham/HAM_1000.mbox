Hello Bob,

I hope you had a great weekend! I wanted to share a quick update on the marketing dashboard project. Over the past week, I completed the data integration phase and refined the visualization layout. The dashboard now displays real-time metrics for web traffic, conversion rates, and social media engagement.

Next steps:
- Finalize color scheme and chart labels by Wednesday.
- Run a usability test with the design team on Thursday afternoon.
- Prepare a short demo for the stakeholders on Friday.

Let me know if you have any feedback or if you’d like to add other metrics to the report. I’ll also schedule a brief call tomorrow at 11 AM to go over any questions you may have.

Thanks,
Alice
