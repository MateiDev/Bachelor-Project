Hi there,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to see if you’d like to join me and a few colleagues for lunch next Tuesday at 12:30 PM. We’re planning to try out the new Italian bistro that just opened downtown. It’s supposed to have great pasta and pastries.

If you’re free, let me know and I’ll reserve a table. If next Tuesday doesn’t work, we can find another day that’s convenient for everyone.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alex Johnson
