Hi Bob,

Just a quick reminder that our team potluck lunch is scheduled for this Thursday at 12:30 PM in the main conference room. We’re planning to set up buffet-style, so feel free to bring any dish you like. If you could let me know what you plan to bring by Wednesday afternoon, that would be great—so we can avoid duplicates.

Here are a few suggestions if you’re still deciding:
- Salads or side dishes
- Sandwich platters
- Desserts (cookies, brownies, or fruit)
- Drinks (iced tea, lemonade, or sodas)

We’ll provide plates, utensils, napkins, and cups. If you have any dietary restrictions or need assistance with reheating, please mention that when you RSVP.

Thanks, and looking forward to a fun get-together!

Best,
Alice Johnson
Office Coordinator
