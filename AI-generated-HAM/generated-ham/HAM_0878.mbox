Hi Bob,

Thanks for sending over the initial draft of the project update. I reviewed the document and added a few comments:

- Section 2.2: I clarified the timeline for the client presentation.
- Section 3.1: I updated the budget figures based on our last meeting.
- Section 4: Please confirm if we should allocate additional resources to testing.

Could you take a look at my notes and let me know if we're aligned? Once we finalize this version, I'll circulate it to the wider team.

Enjoy your weekend,
Alice
