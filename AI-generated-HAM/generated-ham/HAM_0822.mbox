Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. Here’s the agenda for our weekly team meeting tomorrow:

1. Project Alpha status update
2. Marketing campaign results review
3. Resource allocation for next sprint
4. Q&A and open discussion

Please review the attached draft slides before the meeting and let me know if you have any questions or additional topics to add. We’ll meet in Conference Room B at 10:00 AM.

Looking forward to a productive session.

Best regards,
Alice
