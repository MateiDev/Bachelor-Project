Hello Team,

This is a friendly reminder that our monthly team meeting is scheduled for Thursday,
August 3, 2023 at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. We will discuss progress on current
projects, upcoming deadlines, and allocate tasks for next month.

Agenda:
- Project A status update
- Budget review for Q3
- Timeline adjustments for Project B
- Team feedback and open discussion

Please review the project summary document in our shared drive before the meeting and
be prepared to share any updates. If you have any items you'd like to add to the
agenda, send them to me by Wednesday morning.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
