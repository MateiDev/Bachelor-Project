Hello Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. As discussed in our last meeting, we'll start planning the next product launch campaign. I'd like to schedule a brainstorming session next Tuesday at 2 PM in Conference Room B.

Please come prepared with ideas for:
- Social media strategies
- Email outreach
- Partner collaborations

Let me know if this time works for you or if we need to adjust. Looking forward to your creative input!

Best regards,
Alice
