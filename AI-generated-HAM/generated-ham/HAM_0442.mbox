Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I've updated the project timeline document in our shared drive based on our discussion last week. Here are the key changes:

1. User research phase: July 12 – July 20  
2. Design prototyping: July 22 – July 29  
3. Development kickoff: August 2, with an expected completion by September 15  
4. Testing and QA: September 16 – October 1  

Please take a look when you have a moment and let me know if you have any feedback or see any potential conflicts. If everything looks good, I'll notify the rest of the team and adjust our calendar invites accordingly.

Thanks for your input—looking forward to keeping the project on track.

Best regards,
Alice
