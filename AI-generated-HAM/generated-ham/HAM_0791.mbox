Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great weekend. Here’s the update for the Phoenix project this week:

1. Completed the initial prototype for the user dashboard.
2. Integrated the data import module with the new API.
3. Identified a minor issue with the notifications system and started investigating.

We have a review meeting scheduled for Wednesday, July 17 at 10:00 AM. Please let me know if that time still works for you or if you’d like to reschedule.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Thanks,
Alice Brown
