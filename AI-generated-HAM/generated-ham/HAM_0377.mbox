Hello Team,

I hope you’re all doing well. As a reminder, our next project meeting is scheduled for Monday, September 18th at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B, and via Zoom for remote attendees. Below is the proposed agenda:

1. Welcome and Quick Updates (5 minutes)
2. Review of Last Sprint Deliverables (10 minutes)
3. Discussion of Roadblocks and Risks (15 minutes)
4. Timeline Adjustments and Resource Allocation (15 minutes)
5. Action Items and Next Steps (10 minutes)
6. Q&A and Open Discussion (5 minutes)

Please take a moment to review the documents I’ve shared in the team folder:
- Sprint 4 Status Report
- Risk Log (updated Sept 13)
- Draft Timeline for Sprint 5

Action Items Before the Meeting:
- Update your section of the status report with any recent developments.
- Review the risk log and add any new concerns.
- If you plan to propose timeline changes, draft your suggestions in a one-page outline.

If you have any additional topics you’d like to cover, let me know by Friday, September 15th. Otherwise, I’ll assume the above agenda meets everyone’s needs.

Looking forward to a productive discussion. Thanks for your preparation and continued collaboration!

Best regards,
Alice
