Hey Jane,

I hope you're doing well! As we discussed last week, I'm finalizing the details for our weekend hiking trip.
Here's the current plan:

1. Meeting Point: Pine Ridge Trailhead at 8:00 AM on Saturday.
2. Trail: Pine Ridge Loop (approx. 6 miles).
3. Lunch: We'll bring packed sandwiches and trail snacks.
4. Weather: Forecast looks clear and sunny, mid-70s.

Please let me know if you'd like to carpool or if you need any gear recommendations. 
Also, if anyone else is interested, feel free to invite themâ€”just give me a heads-up so I can adjust supplies.

Looking forward to hitting the trail!

Best,
John
