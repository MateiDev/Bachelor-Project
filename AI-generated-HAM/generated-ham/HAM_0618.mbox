Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I’ve finished reviewing the quarterly report you sent over. Overall, it looks solid and well-structured. I have a few suggestions:

1. On page 3, the chart illustrating sales trends could benefit from clearer labeling of the product categories.
2. In the executive summary, perhaps we can highlight the 12% increase in customer retention—it's a key achievement.
3. A brief note on the marketing campaign ROI in section 4 might help stakeholders understand our outreach efforts.

Let me know what you think, and I'm happy to help refine the document further. Also, great job collating the data under tight deadlines—you made it much easier to analyze.

Best regards,
