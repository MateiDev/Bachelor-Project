Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about planning a hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with temperatures in the mid-70s.

Here’s what I suggest:

1. Meet at my place around 8:00 AM on Saturday.
2. Drive together to Pine Ridge Trailhead (about a 45-minute drive).
3. Hike the 7-mile loop, which should take us around 4 to 5 hours at a moderate pace.
4. Pack a lunch and plenty of water; there’s a scenic overlook halfway through.
5. Be back at the trailhead by late afternoon, grab coffee in town on the way home.

Let me know if these times work for you or if you’d prefer to tweak the plan. Also, feel free to invite anyone else from the office who might enjoy the trip. I’ll handle the trail permit and snacks—just bring your hiking boots and enthusiasm!

Looking forward to catching up on the trail.

Best,
Alice
