Subject: Weekly Project Update

Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great weekend! Here’s a quick update on our project progress for this week:

1. Design mockups: Completed initial drafts and shared them with the design team for feedback.
2. API integration: Connected the new payment endpoint in the staging environment; testing is underway.
3. Documentation: Updated the user guide with the latest feature changes.
4. Team meeting: Scheduled for Wednesday at 2:00 PM to review milestones and blockers.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything else you’d like me to cover in the meeting. I’ve attached the latest mockup files for your review.

Thanks,
Alice
