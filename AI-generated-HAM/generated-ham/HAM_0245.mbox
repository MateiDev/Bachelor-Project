Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! As discussed, we're planning our annual summer picnic next Saturday, June 22nd, at Riverside Park. Here are the details:

  * Time: 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM
  * Location: Riverside Park, Picnicking Area #3 (near the lake)
  * What to bring: a dish to share, your own beverages, and a blanket or folding chair
  * Activities: frisbee, volleyball, board games, and a short nature walk at 2 PM

Feel free to invite family or friends. Please let me know by this Friday if you can join and what dish you'd like to bring. If you have any dietary restrictions, just mention them so we can plan accordingly.

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
