Hi Bob,

Just a quick reminder about our hiking trip this Saturday. We'll meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM. I've packed sandwiches, fruit, and plenty of water. The forecast looks clear, but you might want to bring a light jacket in case it gets cool on the ridge.

Let me know if your plans change or if you need any help with gear. Looking forward to spending the day outdoors!

Best,
Alice Johnson
