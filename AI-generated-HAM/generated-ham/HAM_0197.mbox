Hi Bob,

I'm writing to confirm the details for our team picnic next Saturday. So far we have the park pavilion reserved from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.

Here's what I think we should do:
- Bring blankets or folding chairs for seating.
- I'll coordinate the potluck list via the shared spreadsheet.
- We're planning a simple lineup of activities like frisbee, board games, and a scavenger hunt.
- I've confirmed that the local food truck will be onsite around 12:30 PM if we choose to order.

Can you please:
1. Check the spreadsheet and add your dish or snack contribution.
2. Arrive around 9:30 AM to help set up tables and decorations.
3. Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions we should consider.

Looking forward to a fun day out with the team. If you have any questions or need to adjust the schedule, just reply to this email.

Best,
Alice Johnson
