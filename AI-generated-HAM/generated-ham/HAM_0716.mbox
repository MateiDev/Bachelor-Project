Hi Bob,

Just wanted to touch base about our fishing trip this weekend. The weather forecast
looks great, with clear skies and mild temperatures. I was thinking we could
meet at the lake parking lot around 7:00 AM on Saturday morning.

Let me know if that time still works for you. I’ll bring the cooler with
snacks and drinks, and I can also pack some sandwiches for lunch. If there’s
anything specific you’d like me to bring, just give me a heads up.

Looking forward to catching up and hopefully reeling in some big ones!

Best,
Alice
