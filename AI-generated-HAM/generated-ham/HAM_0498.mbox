Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to see if you're free this Saturday for a hiking trip
up at Pine Ridge. The weather forecast looks great, and I'd love to catch up while
enjoying some fresh air. We can start early, around 8 AM, and bring a packed lunch.

Let me know if that works for you, and feel free to invite anyone else who might be
interested.

Best regards,
Alice
