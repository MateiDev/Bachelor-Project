Hey Bob,

Just wanted to check in about our hike this Saturday. The forecast looks great: sunny with mild temperatures around 72°F. I suggest we meet at the trailhead parking lot at Pine Ridge by 8:30 AM.

Here’s a quick checklist of what to bring:
- Water (at least 2 liters)
- Snacks or a packed lunch
- Sunscreen and a hat
- Comfortable hiking boots
- A small first-aid kit, just in case

Let me know if you have any questions or if you prefer a different meeting time. Looking forward to getting some fresh air and enjoying the scenery!

Best,
Alice
