Hello Team,

I hope everyone had a productive week. As a reminder, our weekly team meeting is scheduled for Monday, December 4th at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B. Below is the tentative agenda:

1. Project Alpha status updates
2. Client feedback review
3. Upcoming deadlines for Q4 deliverables
4. Resource allocation and task assignments
5. Open discussion / Q&A

Please review your tasks and come prepared to share your progress. If you'd like to add any items to the agenda, let me know by end of day Friday.

Thanks,
Alice
