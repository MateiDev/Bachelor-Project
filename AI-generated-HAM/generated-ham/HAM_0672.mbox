Hi everyone,

I hope you're all doing well! With summer in full swing, I thought it would be fun for us to organize a team picnic. Here are a few ideas:

1. Date and Time:
   - Saturday, July 29th
   - Noon to 4 PM

2. Location:
   - Lakeside Park, Shelter B (has picnic tables and plenty of shade)

3. Food and Drinks:
   - We'll do a potluck style. Please reply with what you'd like to bring (sandwiches, salads, desserts, beverages, etc.).
   - I'll bring a portable speaker and some games (frisbee, cards, etc.).

4. RSVP:
   - Please let me know by next Friday (July 21st) if you can make it and what dish you plan to contribute.

Feel free to suggest any additional activities or changes. Looking forward to some relaxed time together outside the office!

Best,
Alice
