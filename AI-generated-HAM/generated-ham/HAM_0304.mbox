Hi Alice,

Thanks again for yesterday’s meeting. I’ve compiled the notes and highlighted the key action items:
  1. Finalize the design draft by next Wednesday.
  2. Coordinate with the development team for API integration.
  3. Review the budget estimates and share any adjustments.

I’ll send out the updated timeline by end of day tomorrow. Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything else we should discuss.

Best regards,
Bob
