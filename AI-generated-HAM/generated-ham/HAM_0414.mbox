Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. Are you free to grab lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM? There's a new caf√© near the office called The Green Leaf. I heard they have great salads and sandwiches. Let me know if that works for you, or if you have another spot in mind.

Looking forward to catching up.

Best regards,
Alice
