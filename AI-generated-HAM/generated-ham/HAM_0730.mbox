Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to see if you’re available for a team lunch next Wednesday, October 13th, at 12:30 PM. A few of us are planning to try the new Italian place downtown, La Festa, since they’ve got great reviews and a relaxed atmosphere.

Please let me know if that works for you or if you have other restaurant suggestions. It would be great to catch up outside of the office.

Thanks, and have a great day!

Best,
Alice
