Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing to confirm our plans for the hiking trip this Saturday. The trailhead meet-up is set for 8:00 AM at Pine Ridge Park. I’ve checked the weather, and it looks clear and sunny with highs in the mid-70s.

I’ve already packed a small cooler with sandwiches, fruit, and bottled water. Feel free to bring any snacks or drinks you’d like. Don’t forget your hiking boots and a light jacket, just in case it gets breezy in the afternoon.

Looking forward to catching up on the trail. Let me know if anything changes.

Best,
Alice
