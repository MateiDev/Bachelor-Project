Subject: Picnic Plans for Saturday

Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! The weather forecast looks great for this Saturday,
so I thought it would be fun to organize a small picnic at Lakeview Park.
I’ve reserved a spot by the north pavilion from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM.

Here’s the plan:
- I’ll bring sandwiches, fresh fruit, and iced tea.
- Could you bring some snacks (chips, nuts, or whatever you like)?
- If possible, please bring a blanket and a portable speaker for music.

Feel free to invite anyone else who might enjoy a relaxed afternoon outdoors.
Let me know if you have any dietary preferences or special requests.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
