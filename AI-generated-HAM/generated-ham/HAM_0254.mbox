Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our plans for the weekend hike.
The weather forecast looks clear on Saturday, with temperatures in the mid-60s
and plenty of sunshine. I’ve mapped out a trail near Pine Ridge that’s about 8 miles
round-trip, with some great viewpoints along the way.

If you’re up for it, let’s meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM. I’ll bring
some sandwiches, fruit, and snacks; feel free to let me know if you have any
special requests. Don’t forget sturdy shoes, a hat, and plenty of water.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors together. Let me know
if that timing works for you or if you’d prefer a different route.

Best,
Alice
