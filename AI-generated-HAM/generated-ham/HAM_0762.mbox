Hi Bob,

Are you still up for the hike this Saturday? I was thinking we could head to Pine Ridge Trail around 8 a.m.
The forecast looks clear, and the wildflowers should be in full bloom. Let me know if that works for you,
and if you’d prefer to carpool, I can swing by your place around 7:15 a.m.

Also, I found a new recipe for energy bars that I want to try out. I’ll bring some samples for us to snack on
the trail.

Looking forward to catching up outside the office!

Cheers,
Alice
