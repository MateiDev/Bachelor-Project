Hey Bob,

Just a friendly reminder that we’re meeting for our weekend hike this Saturday at Pine Ridge Trail. Let’s plan to meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM. The forecast looks great—sunny with mild temperatures. Don’t forget to bring:

- Plenty of water
- Snacks or a light lunch
- Sunscreen and a hat
- Comfortable hiking shoes

If you need a ride or want to carpool, let me know by Friday evening. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to adjust the start time.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Best,
Alice
