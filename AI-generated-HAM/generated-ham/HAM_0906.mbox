Hi Bob,

I hope youâ€™re doing well. I wanted to share the agenda for our team meeting this Monday at 9 AM:

1. Project status updates
2. Upcoming deadlines
3. Resource allocation
4. Open discussion & Q&A

Please review the points above and let me know if you'd like to add anything else. Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
Alice
