Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well.

This is a reminder for our team meeting next Wednesday, July 20th at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. We’ll review the status of the Phoenix project, discuss recent milestones, and plan tasks for the next sprint. I’ve attached the latest project report for your review.

If you have any additional agenda items or questions, please let me know by Friday.

Looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the team.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
