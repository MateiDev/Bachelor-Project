Hey Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this Saturday. The forecast looks perfect—sunny with highs around 75°F—and the trail at Bear Creek is in great shape according to recent reports.

Here’s the plan:
- Meet at my place around 8:00 AM to carpool.
- Bring water, snacks, and comfortable shoes.
- We should be back by early afternoon.

Let me know if that still works for you or if you’d prefer a different time. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some fresh air!

Cheers,
Alice
