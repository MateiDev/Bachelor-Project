Hello Bob,

Thanks for attending today's team meeting. Here is a brief summary of the points we covered:

- Project timeline updates will be shared by end of week.
- Design team to finalize mockups by Tuesday.
- QA will begin testing the prototype on Wednesday.

Action Items:
1. Alice to update the task tracker with new deadlines.
2. Bob to coordinate with the design team on resource availability.
3. Everyone to review the updated project plan before Friday.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification. Otherwise, I'll send the next status report on Monday.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
