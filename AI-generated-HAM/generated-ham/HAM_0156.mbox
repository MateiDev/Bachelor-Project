Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! I was thinking about our conversation last week about getting outdoors
more often. The weather forecast for this weekend looks great—sunny skies and mild
temperatures—so I thought it would be a perfect time for a day hike.

There's a scenic trail at Pine Ridge Park that's about 8 miles round trip. It has a few
nice lookout points along the way, and I hear the wildflowers are in full bloom right now.
We could meet at my place at 8 AM on Saturday and carpool, or meet you at the park entrance
around 9 AM if that's easier for you.

Let me know what you think, and if you have any trail suggestions of your own. Looking
forward to getting some fresh air and catching up!

Best,
Alice
