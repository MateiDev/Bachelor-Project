Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. Thanks again for organizing the team meeting this morning. Here’s a quick summary of the action items we agreed on:

1. Update the project timeline by Friday (assigned to Sarah).
2. Finalize the budget proposal draft (assigned to me).
3. Schedule a follow-up call with the design team next Wednesday.
4. Prepare a list of potential risks by end of day Thursday.

Please let me know if I missed anything or if you have any questions. I’ll share the updated timeline draft by Thursday afternoon.

Have a great rest of your day!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
