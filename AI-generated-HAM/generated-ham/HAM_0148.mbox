Hi Bob,

Are you still up for the hiking trip this weekend? The forecast for Sunday looks great—sunny with temperatures around 68°F. I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:30 AM. Don’t forget to bring plenty of water, snacks, and a light jacket in case it gets chilly at higher elevations.

Let me know if this still works for you. I can pick you up around 7:45 AM if that’s more convenient. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some fresh air!

Best,
Alice Smith
