Hello Bob,

Just a friendly reminder that our annual community picnic is happening this Saturday, July 14th, at Central Park from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM. We’ll have food, games, and live music. Feel free to bring your family, lawn chairs, or a picnic blanket.

Here’s the schedule:
- 11:00 AM: Welcome and introductions
- 12:00 PM: Group barbecue lunch
- 1:00 PM: Sack race and tug-of-war
- 2:00 PM: Live acoustic performance by the Parkside Trio

If you’d like to contribute a side dish or dessert, please reply to this email with what you plan to bring. Also, let us know if you need vegetarian or gluten-free options so we can accommodate everyone.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Alice
