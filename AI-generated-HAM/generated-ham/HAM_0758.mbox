Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As discussed, I'm organizing a team lunch next Friday at 12:30 PM at the Blue Bistro downtown. The main points to cover:

- Project updates and timelines
- Team roles for the upcoming quarter
- Feedback on the new workflow

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences. I'll send out a calendar invite once I have everyone's availability.

Best regards,
Alice
