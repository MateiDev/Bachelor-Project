Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. Are you free this Saturday for a picnic at Lakeside Park? I was thinking we could meet around noon, bring some sandwiches, and maybe play frisbee. The weather forecast looks perfect for the weekend.

Let me know if that works for you. Also, if you have any sandwich preferences or want to bring something else, just give me a heads up.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
