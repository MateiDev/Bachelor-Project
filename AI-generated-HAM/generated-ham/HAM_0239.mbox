Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this coming Saturday. The weather forecast looks promising—sunny with highs around 75°F (24°C). I’ve mapped out a 7-mile loop through Pine Ridge Trail that starts at the Willow Creek parking area. It features a scenic overlook around the halfway mark where we can stop for lunch.

Here’s a quick rundown of the plan:
- Meet at the trailhead at 8:00 AM.
- Pack plenty of water (at least 2 liters each) and some high-energy snacks (trail mix, granola bars).
- Wear sturdy hiking boots and dress in layers; the morning could be chilly.
- Bring sunscreen, a hat, and a small first-aid kit.
- I’ll carry a lightweight backpack stove for making coffee at the overlook.

If you want to carpool, I can meet you at the grocery store parking lot on Maple Street at 7:15 AM. Otherwise, just join me at Willow Creek. Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything you’d like to adjust about the route.

Looking forward to some fresh air and good conversation on the trail!

Best,
Alice
