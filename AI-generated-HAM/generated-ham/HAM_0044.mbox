Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As discussed last week, I'd like to share the agenda for our team meeting on Friday:

1. Project updates
2. Upcoming deadlines
3. Brainstorming session for Q4 strategy
4. Any other business

Please review the points above and let me know if you'd like to add any items. The meeting will be at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B, and a Zoom link is available for remote attendees.

Thanks, and see you then!

Best regards,
Alice
