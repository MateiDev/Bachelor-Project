Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. This is a reminder for our weekly project sync meeting on Friday, July 26th at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B. Below is the proposed agenda:

1. Status updates on active tickets
2. Review of performance benchmarks from last sprint
3. Discussion of upcoming feature requirements
4. Blockers and resource needs
5. Open floor for questions and suggestions

Please reply if you’d like to add any topics or if you’re unable to attend. If you have materials to share, send them by Thursday EOD so I can compile the slide deck.

Looking forward to a productive session!

Best regards,
Alice
