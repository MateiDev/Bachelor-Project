Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to invite you and the rest of the team to a casual lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM. We'll be meeting at La Belle Bistro on 5th Avenue. It's been a busy quarter, and it would be great to relax and catch up outside of the office.

Please let me know if you can make it by Thursday afternoon so I can finalize the reservation. If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, just let me know.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
Alice Smith
