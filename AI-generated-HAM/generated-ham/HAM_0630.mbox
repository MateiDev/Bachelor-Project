Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to remind you about our team outing scheduled for next Friday, September 8th. We'll be meeting at 10:00 AM in the lobby of the main office building, and then heading to Lakeside Park for a morning of games and a picnic lunch.

Here's the tentative plan:
- 10:00 AM: Gather in the lobby
- 10:15 AM: Depart for Lakeside Park
- 11:00 AM–12:30 PM: Outdoor games (volleyball, frisbee)
- 12:30 PM–1:30 PM: Picnic lunch
- 1:30 PM–3:00 PM: Free time and park walk
- 3:00 PM: Return to the office

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if you need a ride. It should be a fun day to relax and catch up outside the office. Feel free to bring your family along, too.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
Alice
