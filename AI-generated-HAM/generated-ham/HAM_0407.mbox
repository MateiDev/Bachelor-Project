Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Just wanted to follow up on our plans for this Saturday. The weather forecast looks perfect for a picnic in Riverside Park. I was thinking we could arrive around 11:00 AM, set up near the big oak tree by the river, and enjoy sandwiches, fruit, and some iced tea.

I’ll bring a picnic blanket and some games like frisbee and cards. If you’d like, you can pick up the pastries from the bakery downtown. Let me know what you think and if there’s anything else you’d like to add to the spread.

Looking forward to catching up and spending a relaxing afternoon outdoors. See you Saturday!

Best,
Alice Johnson
