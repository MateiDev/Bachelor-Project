Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share the photos from our weekend hike up Willow Peak. The weather turned out great, and the views were absolutely stunning. I’ve attached a ZIP file containing all the pictures—feel free to pick out your favorites for the photo album.

Let me know what you think, and if you’d like to organize another trip soon. Maybe we can plan something in the spring when the wildflowers are in bloom.

Cheers,
Alice
