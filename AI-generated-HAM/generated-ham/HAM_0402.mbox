Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check if you're available for a team lunch next Wednesday at 12:30 PM. We can try the new cafe around the corner--I've heard they have great sandwiches and salads.

Let me know if that works for you, and if you have any dietary preferences I should pass along.

Thanks,
Alice Johnson
