Hello Bob,

I hope youâ€™re doing well. I wanted to share the latest updates from the marketing team:

1. The June newsletter went out to 5,000 subscribers yesterday and we've already seen a 12% open rate, which is a 3% increase from last month.
2. Our social media engagement continues to grow; Instagram followers are up by 8% and Twitter mentions have doubled since the campaign launch.
3. The ad budget for Q3 has been finalized. You can find the breakdown in the shared drive at /Marketing/Budgets/JuneBudget.xlsx.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss next steps in our upcoming meeting.

Best regards,
Alice Smith
Marketing Coordinator
