Hi Michael,

Thank you for joining the Q3 budget review meeting yesterday. Here are the main points we covered:

- Overall expenses are running 5% under the planned budget.
- Marketing spend will increase by 10% in September to support the fall campaign.
- We approved hiring two additional contractors for Project Atlas.
- Action items: finalize vendor contracts by July 10 and update the expense forecast.

Could you please confirm if I've captured everything correctly? Iâ€™ll circulate the official minutes by Friday afternoon.

Best regards,
