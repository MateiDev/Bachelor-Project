Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to invite you and the marketing team to join me for lunch next Wednesday, July 19th, at 12:30 PM. I’ve reserved a table at The Green Leaf Cafe on Main Street. They have a great selection of salads, sandwiches, and vegan options, so there should be something for everyone.

Please let me know by Tuesday afternoon if you can make it, and if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences. It will be a nice break and a chance to catch up outside the office.

Looking forward to spending some time with the team!

Best regards,
Alice Smith
