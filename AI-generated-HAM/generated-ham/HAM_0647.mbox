Hi Team,

I hope everyone had a productive week. Here’s a brief update on our ongoing project:

1. Design Phase  
   - All wireframes have been finalized and approved by the client.  
   - The UI mockups are complete; thank you, Alice, for your excellent work.

2. Development Phase  
   - Backend services for user authentication are now live on the staging server.  
   - The API documentation has been updated in our shared repository.

3. Testing & QA  
   - Initial unit tests cover about 70% of the core modules.  
   - We’ve scheduled integration testing to start next Monday.

Next Steps:  
- Bob will begin integrating the payment module.  
- Carla will coordinate with QA for performance testing.  
- Let’s aim to have a full build deployed by next Wednesday afternoon.

Please let me know if you run into any blockers or need assistance. Enjoy your weekend, and let’s have another great week ahead!

Best regards,
John
