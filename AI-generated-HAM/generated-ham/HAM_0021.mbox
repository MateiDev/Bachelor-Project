1. Welcome and introductions
2. Discussion of "The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig
3. Snack and coffee break (bring your favorite snack)
4. Brainstorming sessions for next month's book choices
5. Wrap-up and reminders

Please let me know if you have any items to add to the agenda or if you'll need to dial in remotely. Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Alice
