Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! I was thinking about our plans for next weekend and thought it would be great to organize a day hike up Pine Mountain. The trail is about 6 miles round trip and offers some beautiful views from the summit.

Here's a rough itinerary:
- Saturday, July 13
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM
- Estimated return by 3:00 PM
- Pack lunch, water, and sunscreen
- Don't forget sturdy shoes and a light jacket; it can be windy at the top.

Let me know if this works for you or if you'd prefer a different date. Also, if anyone else wants to join, feel free to extend the invitation.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some fresh air!

Best,
Alice
