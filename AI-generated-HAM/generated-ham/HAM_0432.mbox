Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to see if you'd like to join us for a small get-together at my place this Saturday evening. We're planning a casual potluck with a few friends: Emily, Carlos, and Jenna.

Feel free to bring any dish you'd likeâ€”homemade or from your favorite bakery. We'll have drinks, some board games, and a playlist of everyone's favorite tunes. The plan is to start around 6:00 PM and go until about 10:00 PM.

Let me know if you can make it, and if there's something special you'd like to bring or if you have any dietary restrictions we should keep in mind.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice Johnson
