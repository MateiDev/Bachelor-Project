Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check in about scheduling our team lunch next week.
Friday, January 12th, seems to work for most people. Are you available around noon?
If that date doesn't suit, please let me know your availability.

Also, the new deli down the street has some great vegan options, in case you'd prefer
a meat-free meal. I'm happy to make the reservation once we settle on a time and place.

Looking forward to catching up outside of the office.

Best regards,
Alice
