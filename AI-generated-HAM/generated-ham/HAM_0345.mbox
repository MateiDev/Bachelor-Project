Hi everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. With spring finally here, I thought it would be great to organize a team picnic next Saturday, March 25th, at Riverside Park. It’ll be a casual gathering—feel free to bring any games, snacks, or musical instruments you like.

Here’s the plan:
- Date: Saturday, March 25th
- Time: 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM
- Location: Riverside Park, Shelter #4
- What to bring: A dish or snack to share (optional), sunscreen, and a blanket or chair.

Please let me know by Wednesday if you can make it, and if you’d like to volunteer to bring drinks or help with setup. Looking forward to a fun afternoon outdoors!

Best,
Alice Johnson
