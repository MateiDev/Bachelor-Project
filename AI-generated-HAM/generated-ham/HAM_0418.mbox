Hi Bob,

Just checking if you're still up for the hike this Saturday. The weather looks great, with clear skies and moderate temperatures. I was thinking we could start at Greenwood Trailhead around 9 AM, pack some sandwiches and snacks, and aim to finish by late afternoon. Let me know if that works for you or if you prefer a different time.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
