Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to check in about our plans for this weekend. The weather forecast looks great, and I was thinking it would be the perfect opportunity for a day hike at Bear Mountain State Park.

I found a route that starts at the Perkins Memorial Tower trailhead. It's about a 7-mile loop, with some great viewpoints along the way. We could meet at my place around 8:00 AM on Saturday, drive up together, and be on the trail by 9:30 AM. That should give us plenty of time to enjoy the scenery and get back before dinner.

Let me know if that works for you or if you’d prefer a different trail. Also, if you need to borrow any gear—like trekking poles or a daypack—just let me know. I have extra.

Looking forward to getting some fresh air and catching up!

Best,
Alice
