Hi Jane,

Thank you for attending today’s marketing team meeting. Here are the key takeaways:

- We agreed on the new social media schedule for July and August.
- The budget for the online ads campaign has been approved.
- Alice will draft the content calendar by next Wednesday.
- We will review performance metrics at our next meeting on July 10th.

Please let me know if I missed anything or if you have any questions. I’ll follow up later with the detailed minutes.

Best regards,
John
