Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on the Delta Project:

- Completed integration of the API endpoints.
- Finalized the UI mockups with the design team.
- Conducted performance tests; everything is within acceptable thresholds.

For next steps, let’s schedule a meeting to review the test results and plan the rollout schedule. I’m available Monday and Tuesday afternoons. Please let me know which time works best for you.

Thanks,
Alice Johnson
