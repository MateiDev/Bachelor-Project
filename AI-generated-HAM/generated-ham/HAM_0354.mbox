Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about the hiking trip next weekend. I checked the weather forecast, and it looks like clear skies and mild temperatures—perfect conditions for a trail adventure.

Here’s a rough itinerary:
1. Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM on Saturday.
2. Hike the Riverside Loop (approx. 6 miles).
3. Lunch break near the river bank around noon.
4. Continue on the Old Oak Ridge Trail for another 4 miles.
5. Return to the parking lot by 4:00 PM.

Please remember to bring:
- Plenty of water (at least 2 liters per person)
- Energy snacks and a packed lunch
- A light rain jacket (just in case)
- Sunscreen and a hat
- Comfortable hiking boots

Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if you’d like to adjust the schedule. If you’d prefer a shorter route, we can skip the Ridge Trail and focus on the Riverside Loop only.

Looking forward to your thoughts. It’ll be great to catch up and enjoy the outdoors together!

Best,
Alice
