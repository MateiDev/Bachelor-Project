Hi Bob,

I hope you’re having a great Friday. As we prepare for our project meeting next Monday, I’ve attached the final agenda below:

1. Project Status Updates
2. Budget Review
3. Timeline Adjustments
4. Team Assignments
5. Q&A and Next Steps

Please review the agenda and let me know if there’s anything you’d like to add or adjust. We’ll start promptly at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B, so plan to arrive a few minutes early.

Looking forward to a productive session. Enjoy your weekend!

Best regards,
Alice
