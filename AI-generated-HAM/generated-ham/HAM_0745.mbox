Hi Bob,

Just a friendly reminder about our quarterly team lunch next Wednesday, July 17th, at 12:30 PM. We’ll be meeting at Bella Pasta, the Italian restaurant on Maple Street. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if there’s somewhere else you’d prefer.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone and hearing how the new project is going!

Cheers,
Alice
