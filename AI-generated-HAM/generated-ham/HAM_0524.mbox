Hi John,

I hope you're doing well. It was great meeting with you yesterday to discuss the quarterly marketing campaign. I've updated the draft outline and budget breakdown, and you can review them on our shared drive under Projects/Marketing/Q2.

Also, our design team has already started creating the mockups based on our discussion. We expect to have the first set of visuals by next Wednesday. I'll send them over for your review as soon as they're ready.

Thanks again for your time, and I look forward to collaborating on this project. Let me know when you're available for a quick call next week to go over the final details.

Best regards,
Alice
