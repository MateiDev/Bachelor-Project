Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our plans for the hiking trip this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great, with clear skies and temperatures in the mid-60s.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM.
- Bring plenty of water, snacks, and a light lunch.
- Wear sturdy hiking boots and dress in layers.
- Don’t forget sunscreen and a hat!

I’ve attached a simple map of the trail route to this email. It’s a 6-mile loop with some moderate elevation gain, so we should be back by early afternoon.

Let me know if that schedule works for you or if you’d prefer a slightly later start. Looking forward to getting out into nature and catching up!

Best,
Alice
