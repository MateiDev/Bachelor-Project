Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to firm up the details for our get-together this Saturday. Here’s what I have so far:

1. Time: 3:00 PM – we’ll start firing up the grill around then.
2. Location: My backyard, 123 Maple Street. There’s plenty of seating and room for the kids to play.
3. Food: I’ll handle burgers and hot dogs. Could you bring a side dish or salad? Potato salad is always a hit!
4. Drinks: I’ll have soda, water, and iced tea. Feel free to bring anything else you’d like.
5. Music: I’ll put together a playlist, but if you have any favorite tunes, send them my way.

Let me know if that works for you or if you’d like to add anything else to the menu. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying some sunshine!

Best,
John
