Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to check in about our plans for the weekend hiking trip. The weather forecast looks great for Saturday morning at the Pine Ridge trail. I suggest we meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM.

I'll pack some sandwiches and snacks, and don't forget to bring water, sunscreen, and a light jacket. Let me know if that time works for you or if you'd prefer a different schedule.

Looking forward to spending the day outdoors and catching up.

Cheers,
Alice
