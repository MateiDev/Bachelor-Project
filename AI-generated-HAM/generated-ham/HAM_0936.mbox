Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. Just confirming our plans for the weekend hiking trip up at Pine Ridge. Here’s what I’m thinking:

1) Departure: We meet at my place around 7:30 AM on Saturday and drive up together.
2) Trail: We’ll take the Lakeside Loop, which is about 8 miles with some moderate elevation gain.
3) Gear: Don’t forget sturdy hiking boots, a light rain jacket (just in case), and plenty of water. I’ll pack some snacks and sandwiches.
4) Weather: The forecast calls for partly cloudy skies, with a high near 75°F. Should be perfect for hiking.
5) Return: We’ll aim to be back by early evening—around 6 PM—so you shouldn’t miss dinner plans.

Let me know if that schedule works for you or if you have any suggestions. Looking forward to spending some time outdoors!

Best,
Alice
