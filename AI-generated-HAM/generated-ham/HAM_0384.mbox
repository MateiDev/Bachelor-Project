Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to remind you about our team lunch
scheduled for this Friday at 12:30 PM. We're planning to meet at Bella's
Trattoria, which is located downtown on Elm Street. The restaurant has
options for everyone—including vegetarian and gluten-free dishes.

Please let me know by Wednesday if you have any dietary restrictions or
preferences, so I can finalize our reservation. If you’d like to carpool,
just reply with your availability, and I can coordinate a pickup time.

Looking forward to catching up with you and the rest of the team.

Best regards,
Alice
