Hi Team,

I hope you're all doing well. As discussed in last week's meeting, we will be organizing
a team outing next Friday (August 6th) at Lakeside Park. The plan is to meet at the
park entrance at 10:00 AM and spend the morning playing games and having a picnic.

Please let me know by Tuesday (August 3rd) if you have any dietary restrictions or
preferences so we can arrange the catering accordingly. Also, feel free to bring
any outdoor games or sports equipment you like.

Looking forward to a fun day together!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
