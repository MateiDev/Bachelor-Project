Hey Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this coming Saturday. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with highs around 75°F.

Here’s the current plan:
1. Meet at my place at 8:00 AM.
2. Drive out to Pine Ridge Trailhead (about an hour’s drive).
3. Hike the Ridge Loop (approximately 10 miles, moderate difficulty).
4. Stop for lunch by the creek around noon—I'll pack sandwiches and snacks.
5. Head back down in the afternoon, aiming to be back home by 5:00 PM.

Let me know if that schedule works for you, or if you’d prefer any changes. Also, please bring:
- Sturdy hiking boots
- Water bottle (at least 2 liters)
- Sunscreen and hat
- Light jacket (it can get breezy on the ridge)
- Any personal snacks or gear you like

Feel free to invite anyone else who might enjoy the hike—just give me a heads-up so I can adjust carpooling arrangements.

Looking forward to hitting the trails!

Best,
Alice
