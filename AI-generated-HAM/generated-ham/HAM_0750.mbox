Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm planning a team lunch next Wednesday at the new Italian place downtown. It would be great if you could join us. We're meeting at 12:30 PM in front of the office. Please let me know if that works for you.

Also, if you have any dietary restrictions, let me know so I can make arrangements.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
Alice Smith
