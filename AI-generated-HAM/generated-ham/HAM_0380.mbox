Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our plan for the hiking trip this Saturday.
The weather forecast looks great—sunny skies and mild temperatures.

Here's what I was thinking:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM.
- Bring your usual hiking gear, water, and a light lunch.
- I'll pack some snacks and extra water bottles.
- The trail is about 6 miles round-trip, with a scenic overlook halfway.

Let me know if that schedule works for you or if you’d prefer to start a bit later.
Also, if you have any dietary restrictions, just give me a heads-up and I’ll adjust the snacks.

Looking forward to spending the day outdoors and catching up. It’s been too long since our last adventure!

Best,
Alice
