Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I'm writing to share the final details for our weekend hiking trip next Saturday.

Meeting Point and Time:
- We'll meet at the Pine Ridge trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM.
- Look for my blue Subaru Outback.

What to Bring:
- Plenty of water (at least 2 liters).
- Snacks or a packed lunch.
- Comfortable hiking boots and layered clothing.
- Sunscreen and a hat.

Trail Plan:
- We'll start with the Pine Ridge Loop (approximately 6 miles).
- After a short lunch break by the river, we can decide if we want to add the Ridgeview Extension for another 2 miles.
- Expect to finish around 3:00 PM, weather permitting.

If you have any questions or need to adjust the plan, just let me know. I'm really looking forward to spending the day outside and catching upâ€”it's been too long since our last adventure!

Safe travels, and see you soon!

Best,
Alice Johnson
