Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to give you a quick update on the Stellar Project. As of this week, we've completed the initial design phase and are moving into development.

Here's the plan for next steps:
- Finalize the UI mockups by next Tuesday.
- Schedule a kickoff meeting with the development team.
- Review the API documentation draft.

Could you please let me know your availability for the kickoff meeting? I'm thinking Wednesday afternoon or anytime Thursday morning.

I'll share the mockup files via our shared drive once they're ready.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Alice
