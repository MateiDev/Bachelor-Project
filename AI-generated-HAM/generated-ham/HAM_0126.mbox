Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well! With summer in full swing, I’d like to organize a casual team picnic next Friday, June 28th, at Lakeview Park. We’ll aim to start around noon and wrap up by 4 PM.

I’ll bring sandwiches, snacks, and beverages. If you have dietary restrictions or would like to contribute a dish, please let me know by end of day Wednesday so I can coordinate. We’ll also plan for a few games— frisbee, cornhole, and maybe a trivia quiz.

Feel free to bring family members or significant others. It should be a fun opportunity to unwind and catch up outside the office. Please RSVP by Thursday, June 20th, so I can finalize headcount.

Looking forward to a relaxing afternoon together!

Best,
Alice Johnson
