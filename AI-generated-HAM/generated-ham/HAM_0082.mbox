Hi Jane,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our outing this Saturday. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with a light breeze—so I think it’s a great day for that hike up Pine Ridge Trail we’ve been talking about.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Meet at my place at 8:00 AM and drive together.
- Stop by Green Valley Market on the way for sandwiches, fruit, and cold drinks.
- Aim to start the hike by 9:30 AM.
- Bring a picnic blanket and some snacks to enjoy at the summit.

I’ll pack a first-aid kit, extra water, and some granola bars. Let me know if you have any dietary preferences or if there’s anything else you’d like to bring. Also, don’t forget sunscreen and a hat!

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the great outdoors. Let me know if the plan works for you or if you’d prefer a different time.

Best,
John
