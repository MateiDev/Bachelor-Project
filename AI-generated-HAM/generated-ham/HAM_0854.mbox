Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks perfect for Saturday—sunny with mild temperatures in the mid-70s. I’ve mapped out a 6-mile loop in Pine Ridge Preserve that includes a scenic overlook and a small waterfall.

Here’s the plan:
- Departure: 8:00 AM from my place (I’ll pick you up at 7:45 AM).
- Trailhead arrival: around 9:00 AM.
- Lunch break: bring your own sandwich or snacks; there’s a picnic area near the overlook.
- Estimated return: around 2:00 PM.

Don’t forget to pack:
1. Sturdy hiking boots
2. Water (at least 2 liters)
3. Sunblock and a hat
4. Lightweight rain jacket (just in case)

Let me know if this schedule works for you or if you’d like to adjust anything. Looking forward to getting some fresh air and catching up!

Best,
Alice
