Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to see if you'd be interested in joining a small group hike this coming Saturday morning. We're planning to meet at the Pine Ridge Trailhead around 8:00 AM. The trail is about 6 miles long with moderate elevation gain, and there are several scenic overlooks.

I've spoken to Carol, David, and Emma, and they're all in. We'll bring plenty of water and snacks, but feel free to pack your favorite trail mix or energy bars. Don't forget sunscreen and a hat. If you'd like, we can grab brunch afterward at the Lakeside Caf√© at around 12:30 PM.

Let me know if you're available and if you need a ride. It should be a fun, relaxed morning outdoors.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Alice
