Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well! With the weather looking great this weekend, I thought we could organize a small picnic at Riverside Park on Saturday afternoon. Iâ€™m thinking we meet by the main fountain around 1:00 PM. 

I can bring sandwiches, fruit, and some lemonade. Could you handle chips and maybe a blanket? If you want to invite anyone else, feel free to let me know. Also, if the park gets crowded, we can move to the southwest lawn.

Looking forward to it! Let me know if that works for you.

Best,
John
