Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I’m planning a hiking trip this Saturday to Blue Ridge Park. The trail is about 8 miles long, with scenic overlooks and a nice waterfall near the halfway point. The weather forecast looks sunny and mild, perfect for a morning adventure.

Would you like to join Sarah and me? We’re meeting at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM. Feel free to bring along some snacks, water, and your camera if you want to capture the views. If you have comfortable hiking shoes and a light backpack, that’ll be all you need.

Let me know if you can make it. It’ll be a fun way to get some fresh air and catch up!

Best,
Alice
