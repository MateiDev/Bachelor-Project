Hi Bob,

I hope your week is going well. I wanted to check if you’re still up for the hike this Saturday. The trailhead parking lot opens at 8:00 AM, so we could meet around 7:30 AM at my place to carpool. The weather forecast looks promising: clear skies with temperatures in the mid-70s.

Here’s a quick packing list:
- Comfortable hiking boots
- Water (at least 2 liters per person)
- Snacks and a light lunch
- Sunscreen and a hat
- A light jacket, in case it gets breezy at the summit

Let me know if you’d like to adjust the meeting time or if you have any other trail suggestions. I’m flexible and can adapt to whatever works best for you.

Looking forward to a good hike and catching up!

Best,
Alice
