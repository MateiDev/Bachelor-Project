Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The trailhead at Pine Ridge opens at 7:00 AM on Saturday, so I was thinking we could meet at my place around 6:15 AM and carpool there. It should take about 45 minutes to get to the park.

Here’s a quick checklist of what to bring:
- Sturdy hiking boots or trail shoes
- Water bottles (at least 2 liters per person)
- Light snacks (granola bars, trail mix, fruit)
- Sunscreen and a hat
- A small first-aid kit (just in case)

The weather forecast looks clear and sunny, with temperatures in the mid-70s. After the 8-mile loop, there’s a scenic overlook where we can stop for lunch. I’ll pack some sandwiches and fresh fruit, but feel free to bring any additional snacks or drinks you prefer.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything else you’d like to bring. Looking forward to getting out in nature and catching up!

See you Saturday,
Alice Johnson
