Hello Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to invite you to our monthly book club meeting this Friday, July 19th at 7:00 PM in the community center. This month, we’ll be discussing "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho.

Please let me know if you can make it. Feel free to bring snacks and any friends who might enjoy the discussion.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
