Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. This is a quick reminder that our team lunch is scheduled for next Wednesday, January 19th at 12:30 PM in the conference room on the 3rd floor. Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences by Monday so I can finalize the order.

Additionally, we'll have a brief project update meeting right after lunch. We'll cover:
- Current milestones and upcoming deadlines
- Resource allocation for the next sprint
- Open action items and any blockers

Feel free to bring any questions or topics you'd like to discuss. Thanks, and I look forward to catching up over lunch!

Best regards,
Alice
