Hey Bob,

I just heard about the new café that opened on Pine Street, "The Green Bean". They have a great selection of sandwiches and pastries, and the coffee is supposed to be excellent.

Would you be interested in grabbing lunch there tomorrow around noon? Let me know if that works for you.

Best,
Alice
