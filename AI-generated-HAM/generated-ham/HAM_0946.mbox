Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! As discussed in our last meeting, I’d like to organize a casual team lunch next Wednesday, April 19th. I’ve found a nice rooftop café downtown that has a good variety of dishes and outdoor seating. 

Please let me know if you’re available, and if you have any dietary restrictions or cuisine preferences. I’ll send out a calendar invite once I have RSVPs from everyone.

Looking forward to catching up over lunch!

Best regards,
Alice
