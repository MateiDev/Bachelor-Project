Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. As we approach the end of the quarter, I wanted to start planning our team lunch. It's been a while since we all got together outside of work, and I thought it would be nice to pick a date and venue soon.

Here are a few ideas:
- The Green Leaf Café (casual, vegetarian-friendly)
- Mario’s Italian Bistro (pasta and pizza specials)
- Sakura Sushi (lunch rolls and bento sets)

Could you let me know your availability next week? Also, if you have any other suggestions for a place or dietary considerations, please share.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
