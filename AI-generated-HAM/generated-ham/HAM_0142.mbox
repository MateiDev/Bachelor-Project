Message-ID: <20230714091522.AJ@example.com>

Hello Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share a quick update on the office summer picnic scheduled for August 5th at Riverside Park.

1. Venue and Schedule:
   - We’ll reserve Shelter B from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM.
   - The company picnic games (tug-of-war, relay races) will start at 12:00 PM.

2. Food and Drinks:
   - I’m coordinating with “Green Leaf Catering” for sandwich platters, salads, and fruit trays.
   - Could you handle bringing assorted beverages (water, soda, iced tea)? Please let me know your preference by Friday.

3. Activities:
   - We have a portable speaker for music; if you have any playlists to suggest, feel free to share.
   - Friendly reminder to bring lawn chairs or blankets for seating.

4. RSVP:
   - So far, 25 colleagues have confirmed attendance.
   - If you know of anyone else interested, please remind them to RSVP by next Wednesday.

Please let me know if you have any questions or additional ideas. Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best regards,
Alice
