Hello Project Team,

I hope everyone had a productive week. Hereâ€™s a brief summary of where we stand:

- Design phase completed and approved by stakeholders.
- Development for Module X is on schedule and currently 60% complete.
- Testing environment setup is finalized; QA can begin next Monday.
- I resolved the deployment script error reported on Wednesday.

Please review the latest project report in our shared drive folder and share any comments by Tuesday morning. Let me know if you need further clarification on any point.

Looking forward to our next meeting on Wednesday at 10 AM.

Have a great weekend!

Best,
Alice
