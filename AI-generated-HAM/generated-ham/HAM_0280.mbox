Hi Bob,

Thanks for attending the community garden meeting last Saturday. It was great to see so many volunteers interested in expanding the flower beds and starting a composting program. Here’s a quick summary of our action items:

1. Soil Testing: Carla will drop off soil samples at the extension office by Friday, July 28.
2. Tool Inventory: We need volunteers to catalog all the tools in the shed. David and Priya offered to lead this on Saturday morning.
3. Compost Bin Assembly: Materials arrive next Wednesday (July 26). Let’s meet at 9:00 AM to put the bin together.
4. Planting Schedule: I’ll draft a planting calendar for tomatoes, peppers, and marigolds and share it by Monday.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you’d like to take on a task not listed above. Our next meeting is scheduled for Monday, July 31 at 6:30 PM in the community center.

Looking forward to making our garden thrive!

Best regards,
Alice Walker
