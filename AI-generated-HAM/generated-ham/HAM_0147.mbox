Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our plans for this weekend. The weather forecast looks great for Saturday afternoon, so I thought it would be perfect for our picnic at Riverside Park.

Here's what I have in mind:
- We'll meet at the park entrance around 12:30 PM.
- I'll bring sandwiches, fresh fruit, and lemonade.
- Could you bring some snacks and drinks? Maybe chips and iced tea?
- Don't forget your picnic blanket and a deck of cards for some fun.

Let me know if that works for you or if you'd like to suggest any changes. Looking forward to a relaxing afternoon outdoors!

Best,
John
