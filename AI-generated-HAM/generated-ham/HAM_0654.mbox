Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our plans for the picnic this Saturday at Riverside Park. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with a slight breeze.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Meet at the north end of the park around 11:00 AM.
- I’ll bring sandwiches, fruit, and lemonade.
- Could you handle the snacks (chips, pretzels) and some paper plates/cups?
- If you can’t make it by 11:00, just let me know and we’ll save you a spot.

Feel free to invite anyone else you think would enjoy a relaxed afternoon outdoors. Also, don’t forget to bring a blanket or folding chairs.

Let me know if this works for you or if you have any suggestions. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
