Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to check if you’re available for lunch next Thursday, July 29th, around 12:30 PM. There’s a new café near the office that just opened, and I’ve heard great things about their sandwiches.

Let me know if that works for you or if you prefer another time or place. Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
