Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to check in about our plans for the weekend hike. The weather report looks great—sunny skies with temperatures in the mid-60s. I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead parking lot around 8:00 AM on Saturday.

Here's the plan:
- Bring sturdy hiking boots and a light jacket.
- Pack plenty of water and some snacks (trail mix, fruit, and granola bars should do).
- I'll bring a portable first-aid kit and a map of the trail.
- Estimated hike distance is about 5 miles round trip, with a moderate difficulty level.

After the hike, we could stop by that new café in town for coffee and pastries. Let me know if that sounds good or if you have any other ideas.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice Smith
