Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! Just a quick reminder that our annual team picnic is scheduled for next Saturday, July 20th, at Riverside Park from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM.

Here’s the plan:
- Meetup by the large oak tree near the pavilion at 10:45 AM.
- We’ll start with lawn games (volleyball, Frisbee, and cornhole).
- Lunch will be served at 12:30 PM—please potluck a side dish or dessert if you can. Sign-up sheet is in the break room.
- After lunch, we’ll have a short team-building activity (it’s fun, I promise) and then free time until 3:00 PM.

Please RSVP by Wednesday so we have an accurate headcount for food and supplies. Feel free to bring along family members or significant others, and let me know if you need directions or have any special dietary requirements.

Looking forward to a fun day in the sun!

Best,
Alice
