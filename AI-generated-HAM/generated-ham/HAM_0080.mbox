Hey Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this coming weekend. I checked the weather forecast for Saturday, and it looks like we’ll have clear skies with temperatures in the mid-70s—ideal for an early morning start.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 7:00 AM.
- Bring plenty of water (at least 2 liters each) and some energy snacks.
- I’ll handle the sandwiches and trail mix; can you bring some fruit and extra granola bars?
- Don’t forget a light jacket for when the temperatures drop in the afternoon.

If you’d like, we can stop by that new café on Elm Street before heading out. They open at 6:30 AM and have great coffee and breakfast burritos.

Let me know if this plan works for you or if you’d like to adjust anything. Looking forward to it!

Cheers,
Alice
