Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. The team has been talking about getting together for lunch this Friday to celebrate the end of the quarter and catch up on ongoing projects.

We’re thinking of meeting at 12:30 PM at The Corner Bistro on 5th Avenue. They have a great menu with vegetarian and gluten-free options, so everyone should find something they like.

Could you let me know by Thursday if you’ll be able to join us? If you have any dietary restrictions or preference for a different location, just reply and I’ll coordinate with the rest of the team.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
Alice
