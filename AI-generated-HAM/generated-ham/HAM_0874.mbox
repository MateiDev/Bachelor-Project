Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our plans for the weekend hiking trip. The weather forecast looks great, with sunny skies and mild temperatures. I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM on Saturday.

Here’s our tentative itinerary:
- 8:00 AM: Meet at the parking lot
- 8:15 AM: Begin the hike
- 12:00 PM: Break for lunch (I’ll bring sandwiches and snacks)
- 2:00 PM: Reach the summit
- 3:00 PM: Start descent
- 5:00 PM: Return to parking lot

Please let me know if this works for you or if you’d like to adjust any of the times. Also, bring plenty of water, good hiking boots, a hat, and sunscreen.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
