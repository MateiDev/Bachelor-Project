Hello Bob,

This is just a quick note to confirm our hiking plans for this coming Saturday. The weather looks promising, with sunny skies and mild temperatures. Here's what I suggest:

1. Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM.
2. Trail: Pine Ridge Loop, approximately 7 miles.
3. Don't forget to pack water, snacks, and sunscreen.
4. We'll aim to return by mid-afternoon for lunch at the lodge you mentioned.

Let me know if this works for you or if youâ€™d prefer a different route. Looking forward to spending the day outdoors and catching up!

Best regards,
Alice
