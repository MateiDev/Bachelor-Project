Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to check in about our plan for this month's team lunch. With the new project kicking off, it would be great to get everyone together for a relaxed meal and some casual brainstorming.

How does Friday, June 25th at 12:30 PM sound? There's a new bistro downtown called The Green Table that offers a variety of healthy options. Would you be able to RSVP by Tuesday so I can make a reservation for the team?

Also, if you have any dietary restrictions or special requests, let me know, and I'll make sure the restaurant can accommodate them.

Looking forward to catching up outside of the office!

Best regards,
Alice
