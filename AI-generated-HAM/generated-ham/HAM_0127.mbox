Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share the latest update on the Phoenix Project timeline. We've completed the initial design phase and received approvals from all stakeholders. The development team has already started working on the API integration, and they anticipate finishing by April 5.

Key milestones:
- Design completion: March 15
- API integration: March 16 - April 5
- Internal testing: April 6 - April 12
- User acceptance testing: April 13 - April 20
- Final release: April 25

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to adjust any of the dates. I'm planning a quick team sync meeting on Thursday at 2 PM; I'll send a calendar invite shortly.

Thank you,
Alice
