Hi Alice,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to confirm our lunch meeting next Wednesday, July 24th, at 12:30 PM. The new café on Main Street, The Green Bean, has outdoor seating and a great menu with plenty of vegetarian options. Let me know if that works for you or if you’d prefer another spot.

Also, I’ve drafted the outline for our upcoming project proposal. I’ll bring a printed copy to our lunch so we can review it together. If you have any preliminary thoughts or items you’d like me to include, please send them over before Tuesday evening.

Looking forward to catching up and planning our next steps!

Best regards,
Bob
