Hi John,

Just a friendly reminder about our project meeting scheduled for next Tuesday,
July 23 at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. We'll review the quarterly report
draft and finalize the presentation slides.

Please let me know if you need to adjust the time or if there's anything else
you'd like to add to the agenda.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,
Jane Doe
