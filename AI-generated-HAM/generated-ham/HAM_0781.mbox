Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As discussed in our meeting last week, we're planning a team lunch on Wednesday at 12:30 PM at the caf√© on Main Street. The menu includes vegetarian and gluten-free options, so please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions.

Once everyone has confirmed, I'll send out a calendar invite. Looking forward to catching up with the team!

Best regards,
Alice
