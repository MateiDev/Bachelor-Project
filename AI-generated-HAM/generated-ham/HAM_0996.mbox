Hi everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well. I wanted to share a quick recap of our team building event last Friday at Riverside Park.

1. Arrival and Welcome  
   We started at 9:30 AM with coffee and light snacks near the pavilion. It was great catching up informally before the games began.

2. Activities  
   • Scavenger Hunt: Divided into four groups, everyone had fun locating clues around the park.  
   • Relay Races: The sack race and three-legged race got quite competitive!  
   • Picnic Lunch: We had sandwiches, salads, and fruit from GreenLeaf Deli.

3. Highlights  
   – Sarah’s team won the scavenger hunt by 2 minutes.  
   – Mark’s sprint in the relay race was impressive.  
   – The laughter during the water balloon toss was unforgettable.

4. Next Steps  
   • I’ll compile photos and share them in our shared folder by the end of the day.  
   • If you have any feedback on the event or suggestions for the next one, please reply to this email.  
   • Let’s plan a lunch meeting next week to discuss Q3 goals.

Thanks again for your participation and enthusiasm. It was wonderful to connect outside the office and strengthen our teamwork.

Best regards,
Alice
