Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share the final details for our weekend hiking trip:

Date: Saturday, July 24th
Meeting Point: Pine Ridge Trailhead Parking Lot
Time: 8:00 AM sharp
Route: Pine Ridge to Eagle Peak Loop (approx. 8 miles)
Difficulty: Moderate

Packing List:
- Hiking boots with good traction
- Hat and sunglasses
- Sunscreen and insect repellent
- Reusable water bottle (at least 2 liters)
- Snacks and a packed lunch
- Lightweight rain jacket (just in case)
- Small first-aid kit

I’ll bring a map and a couple of extra water bottles in case we need a refill. Expect cool morning temperatures that will warm up by midday. We should be back at the trailhead around 4:00 PM.

If you have any dietary preferences or need to carpool equipment, let me know. Looking forward to a great day on the trails!

Best,
Alice Johnson
