Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well. I'm writing to follow up on our plan for the community picnic scheduled for August. I'd like to organize a planning meeting next Wednesday, July 24, at 6:30 PM at the community center. Please let me know if you can make it.

Agenda items:
- Venue decorations
- Food and beverages
- Games and activities
- Volunteer assignments
- Budget overview

Feel free to suggest any additional topics or changes to the schedule. Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
