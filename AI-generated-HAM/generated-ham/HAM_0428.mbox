Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks perfect—sunny with mild temperatures—and I’ve finalized the route:

  - Meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM on Saturday.
  - We’ll head up the Ridge Loop trail (about 7 miles total).
  - I’ve packed extra snacks, water, and a small first-aid kit.
  - Estimated return to the parking area is around 3:00 PM.

Let me know if you need any gear or if there’s something specific you’d like to bring along. If all goes well, we can stop by that café you mentioned on the way home for a late lunch.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors together.

Best,
Alice
