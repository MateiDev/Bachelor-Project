Hi Bob,

Thank you for meeting this morning to discuss the Orion project. Here are the key takeaways:

1. Timeline adjustments:
   - Phase 2 deadline moved to July 10.
   - Client review session scheduled for June 28.
2. Budget updates:
   - Approved additional hours for UI design.
   - Procurement requests submitted for new testing equipment.
3. Action items:
   - I'll draft the revised schedule by end of day Monday.
   - You will reach out to the design team for initial mockups.
   - Sarah will coordinate with procurement.

Let me know if anything is missing or if you have questions. Looking forward to the next steps.

Best regards,
Alice
