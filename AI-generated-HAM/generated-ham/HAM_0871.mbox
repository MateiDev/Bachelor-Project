Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! As this month rolls around, it’s time for our monthly team lunch. Everyone seemed to really enjoy the new Italian café downtown last time, so I was thinking we could give it another try.

How does Wednesday at 12:30 PM sound? Let me know if that works for you and if you have any dietary preferences or restrictions. I’ll make the reservation accordingly.

Looking forward to catching up over some good food!

Best,
Alice
