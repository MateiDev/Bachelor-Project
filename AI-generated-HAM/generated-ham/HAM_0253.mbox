Hi Bob,

Thanks for attending today's team meeting. I appreciate your input on the quarterly goals and the new project timeline. As discussed, here are the key points we need to address:

1. Finalize the draft of the project proposal by Tuesday, July 23.
2. Assign tasks to the design and development teams.
3. Schedule a follow-up meeting next week to review progress.
4. Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.

Please let me know if I've missed anything or if you have additional points to add. I'll circulate the official minutes by end of day Monday.

Enjoy your weekend, and thanks again for your collaboration.

Best regards,
Alice
