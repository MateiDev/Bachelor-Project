Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to see if you’d like to grab lunch tomorrow at the new café downtown. They have a great selection of sandwiches and salads, plus a cozy outdoor patio.

Also, I’m planning a small hiking trip this Saturday with a couple of friends. We’re heading out to Pine Ridge Trail around 8:00 AM. If you’re interested, feel free to join us! It should be a nice day for a walk in nature.

Let me know what you think about lunch and if you’d like to come along on Saturday. Looking forward to catching up!

Best regards,
John
