Hi Mary,

I hope you're doing well! Are you still interested in going on that hiking trip this
Saturday? The weather forecast looks perfect for a day out in the mountains.
I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead around 8 AM and plan a moderate 8-mile
loop. I'll bring some sandwiches and snacks, and you can handle the beverages.

Let me know if that works for you or if you'd prefer a different time. I'm really
looking forward to spending some time outdoors and catching up.

Best,
John
