Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to confirm our plans for this Saturday’s hike.
The weather forecast looks great, and I’m excited to get some fresh air.

Let’s meet at the park entrance by 9:00 AM. I’ll bring some snacks and bottled
water. If you have any trail maps or extra supplies, feel free to bring them
along. Otherwise, just show up with your hiking boots and a good attitude!

Looking forward to catching up on the trail. Let me know if anything changes.

Best,
Alice
