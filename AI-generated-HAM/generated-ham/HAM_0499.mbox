Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! Just wanted to confirm our hiking plans for this weekend. The weather forecast looks clear on Saturday, so I suggest we meet at the Pine Ridge trailhead at 8:00 AM.

I’ll bring some sandwiches, fruit, and bottled water. If you’d like, feel free to pack extra snacks or a thermos of coffee. Also, remember to wear sturdy shoes and bring sunscreen and a hat.

The full trail loop is about 7 miles and should take us around 4 to 5 hours at a moderate pace. Afterward, I thought it would be nice to stop by the lakeside picnic area to relax for a bit before heading back.

Let me know if that time works for you or if you’d prefer Sunday instead. Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Best,
Alice Johnson
