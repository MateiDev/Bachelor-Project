Hi Jane,

Thanks for joining the team meeting yesterday. I wanted to follow up on a few action items:
1. Budget report: Please send the updated figures by Friday, March 8.
2. Venue booking for the Q2 offsite: I’ll confirm availability and share options by Tuesday.
3. Draft agenda: I’ll circulate a first draft by end of day today.

Let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any points.

Best,
John
