Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! Just wanted to confirm our plans for the hiking trip this Saturday. The weather forecast looks clear, with temperatures in the mid-60s, so it should be perfect for a day on the trail.

I reviewed the trail map on the National Park website and found a nice 8-mile loop that starts at the East Entrance parking lot. If we meet there at 8:00 AM, we should have enough time to complete the loop and still be back before sunset. Don’t forget to pack:
- A refillable water bottle (at least 2 liters)
- Snacks or a light lunch
- A light rain jacket just in case
- Comfortable hiking boots
- Sunscreen and a hat

Let me know if that schedule works for you or if you’d prefer a shorter route. Also, feel free to invite anyone else from the office who might want to join—just give me a heads-up so I can adjust car space.

Looking forward to hitting the trail!

Cheers,
Alice Smith
