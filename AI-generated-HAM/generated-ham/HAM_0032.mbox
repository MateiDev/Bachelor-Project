Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. 
The weather forecast looks great, with sunny skies and temperatures around 65°F.

Here’s the plan:
- Meet at my place around 8:00 AM on Saturday.
- Drive to Pine Ridge Trailhead by 9:00 AM.
- Hike the 5.2-mile loop, stopping for lunch at the lake.
- Return by late afternoon so we can grab dinner in town.

Please let me know if that schedule works for you or if you’d like to adjust anything. 
Don't forget to bring water, snacks, and a light jacket in case it gets breezy near the ridge.

Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
