Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great weekend. I'm writing to confirm our quarterly marketing meeting scheduled for Thursday, June 20th at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. The agenda will include:

- Review of Q2 campaign performance  
- Budget allocation for Q3 initiatives  
- Social media strategy updates  
- Timeline for the new product launch  

Please let me know if you'd like to add any topics. I've attached the latest performance reports and the draft agenda for your review.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Alice
