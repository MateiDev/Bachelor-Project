Hello Bob,

I hope you're having a great week! This is a friendly reminder that our next book club meeting is scheduled for Thursday, June 27th at 6:30 PM at the Maple Street Community Library.

We will be discussing "The Silent Patient" by Alex Michaelides. Please let me know if you've finished the book or need an extra copy. Snacks and beverages are always welcome!

Looking forward to another engaging discussion.

Best regards,
Alice
