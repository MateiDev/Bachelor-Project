   - We’ll reconvene on July 26 to finalize the deliverables list.

2. Task Assignments
   - Alice will handle the UX mockups.
   - Bob will set up the development environment.
   - I’ll be drafting the project plan document.

3. Action Items
   - Please share any feedback on the draft plan by Monday.
   - Confirm availability for the July 26 meeting.
   - Let me know if you need any additional resources.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or suggestions. I appreciate your collaboration and look forward to moving ahead.
