Hi Bob,

I hope you had a relaxing weekend. Here’s the agenda for our team meeting this Wednesday:

1. Project updates:
   - Status reports from each department
   - Upcoming milestones
2. Budget review:
   - Q2 expenditure projections
   - Cost-saving suggestions
3. New hires:
   - Onboarding progress for the marketing intern
4. Open discussion:
   - Any blockers or concerns

Please let me know if you’d like to add any other items. I’ll send a calendar invite shortly.

Thanks,
Alice
