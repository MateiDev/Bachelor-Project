Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to see if you'd be up for a mountain hike this Saturday, July 7th. The forecast looks great, with clear skies and mild temperatures. I was thinking of starting at the Pine Ridge Trailhead around 8:00 AM and aiming to reach Sunset Peak by lunchtime.

The trail is about 8 miles round trip with moderate elevation gainâ€”perfect for getting a good workout and enjoying some excellent views. I'll bring snacks, water, and a light lunch to share. Feel free to pack anything extra you might want, like your favorite trail mix or a portable speaker for music during breaks.

Let me know if you can make it and if you need a ride. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Alice
