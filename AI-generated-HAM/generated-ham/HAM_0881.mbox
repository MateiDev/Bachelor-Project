Hi Bob,

Are you free this weekend to go hiking at Bear Mountain? The weather forecast looks great, and I'd love to catch up. Iâ€™m thinking of leaving early Saturday morning around 8:00 AM. Let me know if that works for you.

Also, if you need any gear, I have an extra pair of hiking poles and a backpack you can borrow.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Alice Johnson
