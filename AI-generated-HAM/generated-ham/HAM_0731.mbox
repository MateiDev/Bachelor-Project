Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! As we discussed in yesterday's meeting, the team is planning to get together for lunch this Friday at 12:30 PM. We thought it would be a nice opportunity to catch up outside the office and welcome our new colleagues, Sarah and Raj.

We've made a reservation at The Green Bean Caf√© on Elm Street. They have a private corner table reserved for us. If you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, please let me know by Thursday noon so I can pass that along to the restaurant.

Looking forward to a fun get-together!

Best regards,
Alice

Hi Alice,

That sounds great! I'm free at 12:30 PM on Friday, and I don't have any dietary restrictions. Please count me in.

See you then,
Charlie
