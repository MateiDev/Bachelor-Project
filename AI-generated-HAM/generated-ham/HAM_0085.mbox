Hello Bob,

As we approach the end of the quarter, I'd like to schedule our team lunch to celebrate recent milestones.
Please let me know your availability next week. I was thinking of trying the new caf√© downtown
on Tuesday or Wednesday around 12:30 PM.

Also, could you confirm whether the conference room bookings have been updated for the next quarter?

Thanks,
Alice
