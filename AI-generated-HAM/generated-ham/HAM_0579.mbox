Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to confirm our plans for the barbecue this Saturday afternoon.
I'll bring some burgers and the extra folding chairs we borrowed last time. Sarah is preparing her
famous coleslaw and potato salad, and Dave offered to bring his outdoor speaker for music.

Let me know if you'd like me to pick up anything else from the store. Looking forward to a
relaxing afternoon together in the backyard.

Best,
Alice
