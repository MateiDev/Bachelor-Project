Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to share the details for our upcoming weekend hiking trip to Pine Ridge. We'll meet at the trailhead parking lot on Saturday, July 29th, at 8:00 AM. Be sure to bring sturdy hiking boots, plenty of water, sunscreen, and a light lunch. The trail is about 7 miles round-trip, with some moderate elevation gain near the ridge lookout point.

After the hike, I thought we could stop by Lakeview Café for sandwiches and coffee—it's right off the main road back to town. If the weather holds up, the view from the ridge should be spectacular, and we might spot some deer or wildflowers.

Let me know if you need a ride or if you have any dietary preferences for lunch. Looking forward to spending the day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
