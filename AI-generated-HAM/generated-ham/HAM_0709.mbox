Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well and enjoying the summer so far. Just a quick reminder that our next Summer Book Club meeting is coming up this Saturday, July 27th, at 3:00 PM in the community center’s meeting room A.

We’ll be discussing “The Nightingale” by Kristin Hannah. Feel free to bring your favorite tea or snack to share. If you have any last-minute questions or need directions, let me know and I’ll be happy to help.

Looking forward to seeing you there and hearing your thoughts on the book!

Best regards,
Alice
