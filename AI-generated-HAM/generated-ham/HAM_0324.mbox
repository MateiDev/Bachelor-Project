Hey Bob,

Just wanted to say thanks again for joining the hiking trip this past weekend. The weather was perfect, and I really enjoyed exploring the trails around Pine Ridge Park.

Here are a few highlights:
- We caught the sunset at Eagle Rock just as the sky turned orange.
- The creek crossing near Camp Caves was more challenging than I expected!
- Lunch at the picnic area was delicious—you brought exactly the right amount of sandwiches.

I’m already looking forward to our next adventure. Maybe we can plan a kayaking trip in August? Let me know what dates work for you.

Have a great week!

Cheers,
Alice
