Hello Team,

This is a friendly reminder that our weekly project meeting is scheduled for Friday, March 12th, at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. We will review progress on the current deliverables, discuss any blockers, and plan next steps.

Please come prepared with a brief status update on your tasks. If you have any materials you'd like to share, kindly email them to me by Thursday afternoon so I can compile them into the meeting agenda.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
Jane
