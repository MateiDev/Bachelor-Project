Hello Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to check in about our hiking plans for this coming weekend. The weather forecast looks promising—sunny with temperatures in the mid-60s.

Here’s what I’m thinking:
- Departure: Saturday at 8:00 AM from my place.
- Trail: Pine Ridge Loop, about 7 miles round-trip.
- Gear: Comfortable hiking shoes, layers, sunscreen, plenty of water.
- Lunch: I’ll pack sandwiches and snacks, but feel free to bring anything extra you’d like.

Let me know if the time works for you or if you’d prefer a different route. Also, if you need a ride, there’s room for two more in my car.

Looking forward to hitting the trail together!

Best regards,
Alice
