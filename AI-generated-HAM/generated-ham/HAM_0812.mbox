Hi Bob,

I hope your week is going well! I just wanted to confirm our plans for the weekend hiking trip. We'll meet at the Pine Trailhead parking lot at 8:00 AM on Saturday. The weather forecast looks greatâ€”sunny with a light breeze.

Here's a quick checklist of what to bring:
 - Comfortable hiking shoes
 - Water (at least 2 liters)
 - Snacks and a packed lunch
 - Sunscreen and a hat
 - Light jacket (morning can be chilly)

I'll have extra trail maps and a first-aid kit in my backpack. If you think of anything else we need, just let me know.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the outdoors!

Best,
Alice
