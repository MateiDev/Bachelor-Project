Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast looks great — sunny with a light breeze. I've mapped out a route through Pine Ridge Trail that takes about 6 hours round trip, with lunch at the overlook point.

Here’s the tentative plan:
- Saturday, March 16
- 8:00 AM meet at the trailhead parking lot
- 12:30 PM lunch break at the overlook
- 3:00 PM return to parking lot

Please let me know if the timing works for you or if you'd like to adjust anything. Also, don't forget to bring water, snacks, and sturdy hiking shoes. I'll pack a first-aid kit and some extra trail mix.

Looking forward to a fun day outdoors!

Best,
Alice
