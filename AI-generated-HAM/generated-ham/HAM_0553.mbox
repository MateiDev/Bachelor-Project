Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to follow up on our plan to go hiking this weekend. The weather forecast for Saturday looks great—sunny with a gentle breeze. I’ve been looking at the Pine Ridge Trail, which is about 7 miles round trip with moderate elevation gain. It should take us around 4 to 5 hours at a relaxed pace.

Here’s a quick checklist for Saturday morning:
- Sturdy hiking boots
- Lightweight backpack
- Plenty of water (at least 2 liters each)
- Trail snacks (nuts, granola bars, fruit)
- Sunscreen and a hat
- A light jacket in case it gets chilly

The trailhead parking lot opens at 7:00 AM, so I suggest we meet at my place by 6:00 AM to carpool and get there early. Let me know if that time works for you or if you’d prefer a slightly later departure.

Looking forward to catching up on the trail and maybe stopping for lunch at the overlook around mile 3. I’ll bring my camera to capture some scenery shots.

Talk soon,

Alice
