Hi Jane,

Hope you're doing well! I'm writing to confirm the details for our hiking trip this Saturday. We'll meet at the Pine Ridge trailhead at 8:00 AM. The weather looks sunny, around 70Â°F, so remember to bring sunscreen and plenty of water.

We're planning a 5-mile loop that should take about 4 hours, including a lunch break at the overlook. I'll pack some sandwiches and snacks, but feel free to bring anything special you'd like.

Let me know if you have any questions or need to adjust the plan. Looking forward to spending the day outdoors!

Best,
John
