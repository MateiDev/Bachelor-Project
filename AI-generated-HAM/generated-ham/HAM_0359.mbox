Hi Jane,

I hope you had a relaxing holiday break. As we prepare to kick off the new year,
I'd like to share the agenda for our upcoming team meeting on Thursday,
January 5th at 10:00 AM in the conference room on the 3rd floor.

Agenda:
1. Project updates and timelines
2. Resource allocation
3. Q1 goals and milestones
4. Open discussion

Please let me know if there are any other topics you'd like to add. If you
cannot attend in person, we can arrange a video call. Just reply to this email
and I'll send a meeting invitation with the link.

Looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the team.

Best regards,
John
