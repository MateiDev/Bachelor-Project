Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to confirm that our project kickoff meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, August 22nd at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B. We'll review the project scope, initial milestones, and team responsibilities. Please let me know if you need any adjustments or if you'd like to add items to the agenda.

Attached is the preliminary project charter. Feel free to review it ahead of time so we can address any questions during the meeting. Looking forward to collaborating on this initiative.

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
