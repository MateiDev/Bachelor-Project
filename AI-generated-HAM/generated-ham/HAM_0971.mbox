Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! Just a quick note to see if you're free this Saturday for a picnic at River Park. The weather forecast looks perfectâ€”sunny with a light breeze.

I'm planning to bring:
- Turkey and cheese sandwiches
- Fresh fruit platter
- Lemonade and iced tea
- A chessboard and Frisbee for games

If you can make it, feel free to bring any snacks or drinks you'd like. Let's meet at the large oak tree near the playground around 11:30 AM. I'll send you a text when I arrive.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
