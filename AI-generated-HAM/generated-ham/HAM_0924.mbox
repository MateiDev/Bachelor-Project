Hi Bob,

Hope you're doing well! I was thinking it’s been a while since our last outdoor adventure, and the forecast looks perfect for a sunny hike this weekend. How does Saturday morning at 9:00 AM sound? I’m planning to head up to Pine Ridge Trail, which is about a 45-minute drive from town. The route is moderate—plenty of wildflowers and great viewpoints.

If that works for you, let me know and I can reserve us a parking spot at the trailhead. Don’t forget to bring plenty of water, some snacks, and your camera if you’d like to snap a few nature shots. I’ll pack a small picnic lunch to enjoy at the summit.

Looking forward to catching up and enjoying the fresh air!

Best,
Alice Johnson
