Hey Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this coming
weekend. The forecast looks great — sunny with temperatures in the mid-70s.
I found a few trails in the Pine Ridge area that look promising.

Our options:
1. Ridge Loop Trail: Moderate difficulty, about 6 miles.
2. Pine Valley Path: Easier, mostly level, around 4 miles.
3. Summit Ridge: Challenging climb, 8 miles round-trip with some steep sections.

Let me know which one you prefer, or if you'd like to mix and match. I can handle
packing snacks, water, and a small first aid kit. If there's anything specific
you want me to bring, just let me know.

Also, we should aim to start early — around 8:00 AM on Saturday — to avoid the
afternoon crowds. Parking can fill up quickly, so arriving around 7:45 AM might
be best.

Looking forward to getting outdoors and catching up!

Best,
Alice
