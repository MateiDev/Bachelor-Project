Hi Mary,

I hope you're having a great week! Just a quick reminder that our team lunch
is scheduled for Tuesday, July 2nd, at 12:30 PM at The Garden Bistro.
I've already made the reservation for our group of six.

Additionally, hereâ€™s a brief project update:

- Final design mockups have been approved by the client.
- Development will begin next Monday, with initial focus on the
  authentication module.
- QA will receive the first build on July 9th.

Let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or questions about the agenda.
Looking forward to catching up in person!

Best regards,
John Doe
