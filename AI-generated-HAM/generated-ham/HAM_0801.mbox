Hi Jane,

It was great catching up over lunch today at The Garden Bistro. I enjoyed our conversation about project timelines and the new marketing strategy.

As discussed, I’m sharing the draft outline of our next campaign. Please find the main points below:
1. Audience segmentation and targeting.
2. Content calendar for Q3.
3. Budget allocation for digital ads.
4. Performance metrics and reporting cadence.

Let me know if you’d like to schedule a follow-up meeting next week to review the details. I’m available on Tuesday or Thursday afternoon.

Thanks again for your time and insights.

Best regards,
John
