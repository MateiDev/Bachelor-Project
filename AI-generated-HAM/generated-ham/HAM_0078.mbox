Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great weekend. Here’s a quick update on our current project:

1. Design Phase
   - All wireframes have been approved by the design team.
   - We’re scheduled to present the final mockups in Wednesday’s meeting.

2. Development
   - Backend endpoints for the user authentication module are 80% complete.
   - Frontend integration is on track; Emily will share the first build by end of day Tuesday.

3. Testing
   - QA has received the initial test plan and started drafting test cases.
   - We aim to begin smoke testing by Friday.

Next Steps:
- Finalize mockups and circulate the updated designs.
- Complete remaining authentication endpoints.
- Coordinate with QA for integration test scheduling.

Let me know if you have any questions or need additional details. I look forward to discussing this in our team meeting tomorrow at 2 PM.

Best regards,
Alice
