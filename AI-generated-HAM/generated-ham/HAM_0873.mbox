Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm writing to confirm our plans for this weekend's hiking trip to Pine Ridge. The forecast shows sunny skies and mild temperatures, perfect for a day outdoors.

Let's meet at the trailhead parking lot at 8:30 AM on Saturday. The lot is located off County Road 12, just north of Maple Lake. I'll bring the trail map and snacks. Feel free to bring water, sunscreen, and your hiking boots.

After the hike, we could stop by that cafe we mentioned last time. I heard they have great sandwiches and hot apple cider.

Let me know if that plan works for you or if you'd like to adjust any details.

Looking forward to it!

Cheers,
Alice
