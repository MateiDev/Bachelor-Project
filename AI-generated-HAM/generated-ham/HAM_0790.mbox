Hi Jane,

I hope you're doing well! I'm planning to have a small picnic this Saturday afternoon
at Central Park, near the Bethesda Fountain. The weather forecast looks perfect:
sunny with a light breeze.

I'll bring some sandwiches, fresh fruit, and lemonade. Feel free to bring anything
you likeâ€”chips, cookies, or maybe your famous pasta salad if you have time.
We can meet around 1 PM and spread out a blanket on the grass.

Let me know if that works for you. If you have any other ideas for activities,
we can definitely incorporate them. It would be great to catch up and enjoy
the afternoon outside.

Looking forward to your reply!

Best,
John
