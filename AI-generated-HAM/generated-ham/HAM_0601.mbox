Hi Bob,

Just checking to see if you’re still up for lunch tomorrow at the new café on Main Street. They have great reviews, and I heard their avocado toast is amazing.

Let me know if 12:30 PM works for you. If you'd prefer something else, I'm happy to adjust.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
