Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our plans for the hiking trip next weekend. The weather forecast looks promising, with clear skies and mild temperatures.

Here’s what I was thinking:
- Meet at my place at 8:00 AM on Saturday.
- Carpool to Pine Ridge Trailhead (about a 90-minute drive).
- Bring a packed lunch, water (at least 2 liters), and sturdy hiking boots.
- The trail is approximately 7 miles round trip, with moderate elevation gain.

Let me know if this schedule works for you, or if you’d prefer to adjust any details. Also, feel free to invite anyone else who might enjoy the hike.

Looking forward to hitting the trail together!

Best regards,
Alice Johnson
