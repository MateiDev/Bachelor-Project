Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this Saturday. The weather forecast looks great—sunny with mild temperatures in the mid-70s. I was thinking we could meet at the trailhead parking lot by 8:00 AM to beat the crowds.

Here’s a quick checklist of what to bring:
- Sturdy hiking boots
- Plenty of water (at least 2 liters)
- Snacks like energy bars and trail mix
- Sunscreen and a hat
- Light jacket, just in case it gets breezy
- A small first-aid kit

Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to add. I’m really looking forward to exploring Maple Ridge Trail with you. It’s about a 6-mile loop with some beautiful lookout points—perfect for photos!

See you Saturday morning. Safe travels until then!

Best,
Alice
