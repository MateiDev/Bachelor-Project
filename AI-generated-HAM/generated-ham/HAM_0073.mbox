Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to touch base about our team outing scheduled for this Friday. We’re planning to meet at the Riverside Café at 12:30 PM. The café has both indoor and patio seating, so we should be comfortable regardless of the weather.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or if there’s anything special you’d like to include in the plan—maybe a quick walk in the park afterward or a short trivia session at a nearby spot. If 12:30 PM doesn’t work for you, suggest an alternate time, and we’ll see if the rest of the team can accommodate.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon with everyone!

Best,
Alice
