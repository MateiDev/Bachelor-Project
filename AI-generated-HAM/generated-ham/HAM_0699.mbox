Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great weekend. Here’s the weekly update on Project Phoenix:

1. Design Phase
   - UI mockups for the dashboard are 90% complete.
   - Feedback from the client call on Friday has been incorporated.
2. Development
   - API endpoints for user authentication and profile management are live on the staging server.
   - Junior developer training session scheduled for Wednesday, 2 PM.
3. Testing
   - Automated tests for the user registration flow have a 95% pass rate.
   - Integration testing begins Thursday.

Action Items:
- Could you review the UI mockups and send any comments by Wednesday morning?
- Let me know if you’d like to reschedule the training session.

Thanks, and have a productive week!

Best regards,
Alice
