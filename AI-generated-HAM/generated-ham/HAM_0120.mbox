Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! I finally managed to book that little lakeside cottage for the upcoming weekend.
It's a quaint place with a small dock and a rowboat, perfect for fishing or just relaxing by the water.
I thought it would be a great chance for us to catch up, go for a hike in the nearby woods, and maybe have a barbecue
under the stars.

I've arranged for us to arrive Friday late afternoon. There's a grocery store on the way, so we can grab supplies
for dinners and breakfasts. Feel free to bring anything special you'd likeâ€”I'm planning on grilling burgers and
vegetable skewers one evening and making pancakes the next morning.

Let me know if you need a ride or if you'd prefer to meet me there. Looking forward to a fun and restful
weekend away!

Cheers,
Alice
