Hi Alice,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to touch base about our hiking trip this weekend. The weather forecast for Sunday looks clear, with temperatures in the mid-60s—perfect for a day on the trail.

Here’s the current plan:
- Meet at my house at 7:30 AM.
- Drive to Pine Ridge Trailhead (about a 1.5-hour drive).
- Hike the 8-mile loop, including the hill climb near the ridge for the view.
- Pack a light lunch and snacks (I’ll bring sandwiches and granola bars).
- Plan to finish around 3:00 PM and be back in town by 5:00 PM.

Please let me know if you’d like to adjust the timing or if there’s anything you’d like to bring. Don’t forget sturdy shoes, water, and sun protection. I’ll bring a first-aid kit and a portable speaker for some music at the summit.

Looking forward to it—should be a great day outdoors! Let me know if you have questions or need a ride share.

Best,
Tom
