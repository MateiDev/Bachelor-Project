Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As we discussed in our last meeting, we're planning a summer team picnic on August 5th at Lakeside Park. It will be a great opportunity for everyone to unwind and enjoy some outdoor activities.

Here's the tentative schedule:
- 11:00 AM: Meet at the main pavilion
- 11:30 AM: Team-building games (volleyball, frisbee, and relay races)
- 1:00 PM: BBQ lunch (vegetarian and gluten-free options available)
- 3:00 PM: Board games and casual conversation
- 5:00 PM: Wrap-up and cleanup

Could you please confirm if you can bring the portable speaker and a cooler with ice? I'll handle the picnic blankets and drink coolers.

Feel free to let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or other preferences. Also, if you have any suggestions for additional activities, I'd love to hear them.

Looking forward to a fun day with the team!

Best regards,
Alice
