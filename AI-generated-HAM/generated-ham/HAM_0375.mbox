Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well! It's been a while since we last caught up. Are you free this weekend to grab lunch and maybe check out that new caf√© downtown? I heard they have amazing pastries and a relaxed outdoor seating area.

Let me know what your schedule looks like, and we can pick a time that works for both of us. Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
