Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share some photos from our weekend hiking trip up Bear Ridge. We had perfect weather on Saturday, and the views from the summit were incredible. I’ve attached a few of my favorites to this message.

Let me know what you think, and if you'd like to plan another hike soon, I’m available next weekend. Maybe we can try the Lake Loop trail this time.

Best,
Alice
