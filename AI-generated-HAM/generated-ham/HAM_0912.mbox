Hi Bob,

Summer is winding down, and I thought it would be great for the team to get together one last time before fall projects pick up. Let’s plan a team picnic at Riverside Park on Saturday, October 14th, starting at noon.

Here’s a rough agenda:
- 11:30 AM: Arrive and set up blankets and tables
- 12:00 PM: Lunch (I’ll coordinate a potluck style menu)
- 1:30 PM: Outdoor games (volleyball, frisbee)
- 3:00 PM: Short team photo and casual chat
- 4:00 PM: Cleanup

Could you please let me know:
1. Whether you can bring a side dish or dessert
2. Any dietary restrictions within the team
3. Ideas for games or activities

I’ve reserved two picnic areas near the playground and restrooms. I also checked the weather forecast, and it looks like it will be sunny and in the mid-70s. If anything changes, I’ll send an update by the week before.

Looking forward to some fun outdoor time!

Best,
Alice
