Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. I'm planning a small summer picnic at Lakeside Park next Saturday (July 20th) around 1 PM and would love for you to join us. We'll have sandwiches, fresh fruit, and iced tea. Feel free to bring anything you'd like or just come as you are.

Let me know if you can make it, and I'll save a spot for you.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,
Alice
