Hi Bob,

I hope you're doing well. As summer is officially here, I thought it would be a great idea to organize a small picnic
with the team next month. I checked with the park authorities, and Lakeside Park is available on Saturday, August 12th.

Could you let me know if that date works for you? Once we have a confirmation, I'll send out an invite with all the
details.

Also, if you have any suggestions for activities or food preferences, please share them.

Looking forward to a fun afternoon in the sun!

Best regards,
Alice
