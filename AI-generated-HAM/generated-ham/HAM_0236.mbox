Dear Bob,

Thank you for taking the time to meet me for lunch today. It was great to catch up and discuss the upcoming project timeline. Here’s a quick recap of what we covered:

- Project milestones and deadlines
- Resource allocation and team responsibilities
- Next steps and action items

I’ll share the detailed meeting notes later this afternoon. Let me know if I’ve missed anything.

Looking forward to our next discussion.

Best regards,
Alice
