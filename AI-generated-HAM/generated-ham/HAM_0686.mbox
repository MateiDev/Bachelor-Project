Hi Bob,

I hope you had a great weekend. I'm writing to share the agenda for our planning meeting next Tuesday, March 14th at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B.

1. Project status updates
2. Budget review for Q2
3. New resource allocations
4. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
5. Next steps and action items

Please let me know if you'd like to add any other topics or make changes. Also, if you can't make it in person, we can set up a video callâ€”just send me your preferred link.

Looking forward to a productive session.

Best regards,
Alice
