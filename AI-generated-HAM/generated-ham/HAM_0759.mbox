Hello Bob,

I hope you're doing well! This is a friendly reminder about our Monthly Gardening Club Meetup happening next Tuesday, April 23rd, at 6:30 PM in the community greenhouse. We'll be discussing spring planting tips, sharing seeds, and doing a brief workshop on raised bed construction. Feel free to bring any seeds or tools you'd like to show off.

The address is:
Greenway Community Greenhouse
123 Garden Lane
Hometown, HT 12345

After the meeting, a small potluck will follow. Feel free to bring a snack or beverage to share.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best regards,
Alice
