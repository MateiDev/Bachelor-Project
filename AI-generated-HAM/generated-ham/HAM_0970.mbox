Hi Bob,

Just wanted to send you the final details for our weekend hiking trip to Cedar Ridge.

Date & Time:
Saturday, July 15, 2023
Meet at 8:00 AM at the trailhead parking lot.

Packing List:
- Hiking boots
- Water bottle (at least 2 liters)
- Snacks (trail mix, granola bars)
- Sunscreen and hat
- Lightweight rain jacket (just in case)
- Camera (optional)

Trail Info:
The hike is approximately 10 miles round trip with moderate elevation gain. We should aim to complete it in about 5-6 hours. There are a few viewpoints along the way where we can stop for photos and lunch.

Carpool:
I'll be driving my SUV. I can pick you up at your place around 7:00 AM if that works for you. Let me know, and I'll share my address and coordinate pickup.

Weather Forecast:
Sunny in the morning, with a slight chance of afternoon showers (20%). Temperatures will be in the mid-70s.

If you have any questions or need to adjust anything, just reply to this email. Looking forward to it!

Best,
Alice
