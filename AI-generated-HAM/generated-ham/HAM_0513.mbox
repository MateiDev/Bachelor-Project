Hi Bob,

Thanks for the productive meeting this morning. Here's a quick summary of the key points and action items:

1. Project timeline:
   - Phase 1 completion by Jan 15.
   - Phase 2 kickoff after stakeholder approval.

2. Design review:
   - UI team to provide mockups by Jan 5.
   - Feedback session scheduled for Jan 7 at 10:00 AM.

3. Resource allocation:
   - Sarah to handle front-end tasks.
   - Mark to oversee backend integration.

Please let me know if I missed anything or if you have any questions. I'll send calendar invites for the upcoming review sessions later today.

Best regards,
Alice
