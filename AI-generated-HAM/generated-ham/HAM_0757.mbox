Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share the final details for our weekend hiking trip next Saturday.

Meeting Point and Time
• Location: Pine Ridge Trailhead parking lot
• Date: Saturday, July 13
• Time: 8:00 AM (please arrive by 7:45 AM)

Route and Difficulty
We’ll be taking the Pine Ridge Loop, which is about 8 miles with moderate elevation gain. The trail is well-marked, but parts of it can be rocky, so sturdy boots are recommended.

What to Bring
• Plenty of water (at least 2 liters per person)  
• Snacks and a packed lunch  
• Sunscreen and a hat  
• Lightweight rain jacket (in case of afternoon showers)  
• First-aid kit and any personal medications

Carpooling
I can drive and fit three people comfortably. Let me know if you need a ride or if you plan to drive yourself. Parking can fill up quickly, so carpooling will help.

Emergency Contact
If anything comes up, you can reach me at (555) 123-4567. I’ll also send a group text the evening before to confirm final details and weather updates.

Looking forward to a great hike and catching up on the trail. Let me know if you have any questions or special requests.

Best,
Alice
