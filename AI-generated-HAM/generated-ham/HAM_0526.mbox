Subject: Team Lunch Invitation

Hi Bob,

I hope you’re having a great start to your week! As discussed during Friday’s meeting, our team is planning a casual lunch outing next Wednesday at The Garden Bistro. We’ll meet in the lobby at 12:15 PM and walk over together.

Please let me know if you have any dietary restrictions or preferences, so I can make a reservation that works for everyone. I’ve heard their seasonal salad and grilled vegetable platter are excellent options.

Looking forward to spending some time outside the office and catching up with the team.

Best regards,
Alice
