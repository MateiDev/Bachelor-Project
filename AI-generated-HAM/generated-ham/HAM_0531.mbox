Hi Bob,

I hope you’re doing well. Just a quick reminder that our team outing is scheduled for this Friday, June 24th, starting at 5:30 PM. We’ll be meeting at the Lakeside Park pavilion, and there will be games, a barbecue, and some refreshments.

Feel free to bring your family along; the park has a playground and walking trails that everyone can enjoy. If you have any dietary restrictions, let me know by Thursday so we can plan accordingly.

Looking forward to a fun evening with the team! Please reply to confirm your attendance.

Best regards,
Alice
