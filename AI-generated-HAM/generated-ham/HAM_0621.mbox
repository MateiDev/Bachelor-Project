Hi Bob,

I hope you're having a good week. Just a quick reminder that our weekly team lunch is happening this Friday at 12:30 PM in the break room. Please feel free to bring any special treats or ideas for discussion. 

Also, if you have any dietary restrictions or suggestions for menu items, let me know by Thursday afternoon so I can place the order accordingly.

Looking forward to catching up with everyone!

Best regards,
Alice

Hi Alice,

Thanks for organizing this! I don't have any dietary restrictions. I'd love to try that new salad recipe we discussed last week.

See you all on Friday!

Cheers,
Carol
